The station's location is just perfect, as it's conveniently situated near the freeway, ensuring a quick and hassle-free pit stop for travelers.

Hotel Mission Del Oro itself is an exquisite property, offering top-notch amenities for those looking to unwind while their vehicle gets charged. The hotel's welcoming ambiance and well-appointed rooms provide a comfortable stay for guests. And if you're an AT&T user, you'll be pleased to know that the cell phone service is excellent in this area, making it easy to stay connected with friends, family, or work.

One of the highlights of this Supercharging station is its proximity to popular walkable dining options. My personal favorite has to be In-N-Out, which is just a short walk away. This iconic fast-food chain never disappoints with its mouthwatering burgers and shakes, making it an ideal choice to grab a quick bite while your Tesla charges. There are several other eateries in the vicinity, catering to a variety of tastes and preferences.

Adding to the convenience, the charging station is equipped with multiple Superchargers, ensuring availability and minimal wait times. The charging process itself is swift, allowing you to get back on the road in no time.

In conclusion, the Tesla Supercharging station at Hotel Mission Del Oro is an excellent pitstop for Tesla owners.

The mobile app, neither iOS nor Android, worked at all. It just errored out with no option. We spent the majority of the time trying and trying again the browser app to get to payment without timing out. The site itself seems to have been created in Italy where the creators assume you are located. The app didn’t work at all unless the charger was plugged in, however the instructions state differently.

If you absolutely need to use this one, here is what you should do.
1. Start with the charger plugged into your car. Scan the CR code on the charger.
2. Follow the prompts but make sure you adjust your address from Italy to US. Also make sure you use your billing address for the credit card you plan to use. The site will take about 30 seconds to load each step.
3. There are several screens where you will need to enter your information.
4. You will need to attempt this process several times because if you get a timeout message throughout any of the steps, you will have to start over from scratch. Trying to get back to where you were will be fruitless. 5. Finally, at the end, you will get a message warning you that the car is not plugged in and you have 60 seconds to do so. The car should already be plugged in and beginning to charge. Do not remove the charger from the car or you will have to start at the beginning.

The charger is located around the back of the building at the furthest point from the front door. Check in up front, get your key, then drive around to charge or you can’t get in the back door as it is locked but opens with electronic hotel key.

The charger is an 8Kwh charger or about 24 miles per hour. It is good if your staying over night. It charges about the same as a 50 amp RV park 15-40 connection. It is not the 16KW I was expecting. I believe the charger has the capacity but the electrician only installed a 50 amp breaker instead of a 100 amp and turned it down.

There are two chargers in the corner of a parking lot at the VERY back. Installation was poorly though out. Instead of one charger for each parking spot they are mounted in the corner of one spot furthest from spot 2, making it difficult to reach the second car.

Neither of the spots are designated electric vehicle.  Making it “not obvious for a ICE vehicle” that it is one of only two electric vehicle charging spots.

-Electrify America continues to be underwhelming, this is a personal opinion but  Volkswagen putting the infrastructure together rather then just paying for dieselgate was a mistake.
-Americans investing in a network similar to or built on teslas, that is if it worked anything like Tesla's Chargers would give more confidence to the consumers to buy EVS.
-VW Group having controls to how they have paid there fines has resulted in pooor quality rhey should have paid directly so Americans could reinvent.
and pay for training for a union in the US to be doing the work.

None of the chargers stalls were working. Tried all of them but nothing.

(In the meantime Tesla has marked the supercharge as “under planned maintenance” for a week.) The ChargePoint charger we went to was a 7 kW charger. After another hour with Tesla to arrange a tow to a faster charger they mentioned that this has to be paid out of pocket and not covered by Tesla. When explained the fact that this was a problem with the supercharger and not the car they mentioned that it might happen that the supercharger would not work at times. Which basically means that the superchargers are unreliable as well and if you’re stuck like us get ready to spend out of your own pocket for a tow. Also after the tow even if you reach the next supercharger there is no guarantee that the super chargers will work. It might be in the same situation as this one ( while on the chat with Tesla they could see that 2 of the stalls were not working but all others were working which was clearly not the case when we reached.

It cost $15 to get access to the parking garage where the superchargers are located.  There was a line of 6 cars waiting for an open charger.  Cars kept coming in and sometimes ignored the line and snagged a charger after previous electric car backed out and was in front of the waiting line, the just arrived new car would take the charger, making the waiting time longer.  With 16 miles left, I had to continue waiting.

I was able to charge car finally, but the long wait caused the preconditioning to wear off and took longer!

Update: drove through a Saturday July 16 2022, late morning, and 3/6 chargers were down, causing a backup of 3 cars lined up waiting for a charge.

The station itself is well lit but it's around the corner of the building so you car will not be visible from any of the businesses in the plaza.  I also find it a little pricey, but probably just compared to charging at home.

The plaza has a Price Chopper supermarket that's open until 11PM so I assume there are no restrooms or other amenities late at night.  There are, however several convenience stores within walking distance which may be open all hours.

On the topic of amenities: if you're charging or just stopping for a while, be sure to eat at the North End Pizza and Tap a few doors down from the Price Chopper.

The mustang driver noticed we must've been waiting for the L3 charger and since they were just topping off while they had some time they cleared out and let us charge. Station worked great to quickly add some miles before we ventured to a friend's cabin in Hayward which is around 120 miles away.

We stopped again just to get enough miles to drop our friend off at home in Uptown Minneapolis and then make it home to our house in New Hope. Again, there was a wait for the Level 3 charger but we were able to add some miles on the Level 2 while we waited. The level 3 ultimately worked great again once it was available.

12281,4278,Absolutely horrible experience. The charger only charges 10 miles per hour and it turns off when Kohl's isn't open so it stopped charging at 11pm.  It wouldn't let us start charging again until the next morning at 9am when Kohl's opened.  We also needed a blink login and had to give credit card info just to use the free charger which was a pain to download the blink app and also download a QR reader app to put in the code to activate the charger..  Big scam Kohl's!!  You are only doing it to be able to say you are supporting the environment when in reality you really don't care.  Putting in the equivalent of a dryer electrical connection would charge 3 times faster.  A regular electrical outlet in a house chargers at 5 miles per hour so this isn't much faster than that.

Overall experience in one word: Pathetic
There are a total of 8 charging plugs, 6 of them are low power and 2 of them are 50kw with exclusive tesla plug.
When I tried to charge with low powered plug, it didn't work, guess I have to register, so installed the android app, completed the registration and right after that I'm not able to login in the same app, 😑😑
So, I used chrome to login (yes it worked from website but app) and tried to charged, guess what, surprise ! All 6/6 low power plugs are not functional. There is no way to know unless you check the website.

So, I moved to 50kw charge port, it charges you 0.3$/min, too expensive, just for 4% of my model 3 LR, (4kw use) it costed me 1.95$ which is not acceptable as it charges based on time not on kw consumed, (coz, after 80% charging speed will be slow on tesla) so you'd be paying more likely 2x of super charging cost.
The speed is not even 1/2x of supercharger but costs you much more.

8815,4137,"This is the only Tesla charging available in hundred miles radius and it didn't work for me during the Labor Day weekend (2020). I left supercharger at Burlington, WA with full charge (280 miles worth), Winthrop is 140 miles one-way, so it was a tight roundtrip with no room for error; so I visited this destination charger hoping to add 30 miles for safety. Neither of the 2 Tesla chargers worked (the charging port glowed red, and the panel said 'charging equipment fault'). The faculty at the lodge tried to reset the chargers a couple of times, but that didn't change anything.

First, the destination chargers are at the top of a mountain that's 12 miles from Winthrop, but takes 25 miles worth of battery to reach from Winthrop -- so, when you go there and the charger doesn't work, you've now wasted 25-30 miles of battery to make that trip up the hill and in vain. No one at the lodge can tell you either upfront if the chargers work or otherwise -- they won't know.

There's a third non-Tesla charger; but beware it's a 30A charger, which will charge about 17miles per hour at best.

I suggest - don't bother with this charging option unless you have a 10kWh buffer to gamble with. Instead, your best bets are some of the camping grounds (KOA for example) that lets you use 50A plugs for 5-6 hours in RV camping slots for $20 or so (of course you'd need your charging cable & adapters).

To reach the chargers, take the first left-turn into the parking lot from Iron Point Road and then turn right again to enter the parking lot. The four parking spaces are along edge of the lot near Iron Point Road, but roughly in the middle of the lot between the the first and second parking lot entrances.

The location could be better. There is no overhead cover against rain and sun, and nothing above eye-level to indicate where in the parking lot the chargers are located. There's no sidewalk nearby and the short charging cables mean you have to park nose-in and cannot pull through when leaving. The rightmost two parking spots are the most convenient - they back onto an aisle between rows of cars, while the two spots on the left are across from a curb and row of cars, which gives you less space to back out.

The Folsom Premium Outlets are convenient if you are traveling Highway 50, less so if you need to get back onto I-80.

738,372,"This has been the most reliable Electrify America (EA) location that I've encountered.  Most EA locations utilize what I've come to think of as ""plug and pray"" technology because that's what EA customers find themselves doing. Praying that the charger is going to actually work.

Thankfully, I've visited this location on multiple road trips up into the Lassen National Forrest. I found that the chargers worked every time which is truly miraculous as any frequent EA customer knows. These appear to be updated charging units and I suspect this explains my good fortune.

Near by food and beverage amenities are abundant. Stoble's coffee is my fav. Lots of options within reasonable walking distance in a safe, small town, downtown district area.

My only complaint is that when this area is busy and the lot is full of ICE cars and EVs, EV drivers who must back into these angled stalls will have some difficulty (i.e. backing in without touching the Rivian in the stall to the right; or the Lucid Air in the stall to the left; or without ramming into bubba's truck nuts equipped tow hitch on the F-250 parked in the stall directly on the other side of the one way lane).

I wish EA wouldn't just cram these chargers into random, small sized parking lots with limited approach angles and limited maneuvering space. For real, when full, it is challenging to back in. Even worse, the cords are too short to reach the back of my teeny tiny Polestar 2 when pulling in nose first!

Though they do power 100% of their electricity from Renewable Energy, via buyback programs with sustainable energy farms. Still pretty expensive…but with Electricity already being drastically cheaper than gas, I don’t mind contributing to a green cause if it means I get awesome parking upfront, more space & security around my car.

This station is seperated into a dedicated parking spot for s level 3 charger and a very accessable level 2 parking spot nearby. Both are located in the NE corner of the underground New Seasons parking garage.

The level 3 charger parking spot is very small, and might not work for larger vehicles. It has a CCS and Chademo plug (but can only charge one car at a time). There is no Tesla plug (though some newer EVgo stations do have them). Charging rates are limited to 50kw, which is excellent for a quick grocery store stop but not appropriate for a complete battery recharge as there is too much demand. It's often occupied during busy times, and there might even be a queue to use it. There needs to be a 60 min time limit for this charger.

The level 2 charger is on the slower side (5.5 kw) but gets the job done. It's expensive for what you get; conversely it's rarely busy.

The DC charging rates are a little steep, too. I loaded $20 into my Zef account, which is now -$18 (total of $38), and I didn't even get a full charge. I was a little surprised the charger didn't simply stop after I ran out of funds.

We had to stop in to charge a Tesla model Y long range on our way to Tennessee. The Tesla supercharger was very easy to find in front of Publix grocery store. There were several stalls available and folks were able to get in, get charged, and get out. It is off of a busy street so it gets pretty noisy but there are lots of food options within walking distance including a Mexican restaurant, Chinese restaurant, Popeyes chicken.

Since this is an actual supercharger our charging wattage here was about 120 kW so we were able to get from 20% to 90% within 35 minutes",1.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

More people were charging in the north area, so I speculated that the locals might know they are higher powered and faster?  But it is also by the first entrance where it isn’t visible yet until you round the corner forms the second entrance. The Tesla navigator strangely takes you clear past the are to the last and third entrance. So if you have been there before you know that. If not you instinctively turn at the middle entrance as the chargers are visible and quite apparent. I suggest multiple improvements to the Tesla website so you can locate chargers with restaurants, hotels and popular  sites.

Since it was below freezing with high winds, calling for help and/or problem-solving at the controls weren't viable. Conditions weren't optimal for troubleshooting. Also, the method to start charging is inconsistent on the Hydro DC chargers - what works there doesn't necessarily work elsewhere.

Luckily, another EV owner  offered to use his card. I don't know what I would have done without his help. Because it's free (a public service), people can and do help each other out - something else to consider when making decisions about $.

For years I'd hit the Sheetz for Food and the Glen Allen Supercharger for fuel, but now I don't have to. There are 8x v3 (250kW / ""Superfast"") charging stalls here at a renovated Sheetz. That means you can stuff your face with all the cheesy, fried, delicious MTO food you're used to while your ride gets a snack of its own. 9 times out of 10, if you order hot food your Tesla is charged enough to get to the next leg of your trip by the time you get it. And as always, the staff here is super friendly and gives you that awesome Sheetz service.

5/5 for clean toilets, a nice fresh renewed look, the new Dolewhip machine! and an easy to pull into charging location away from the crazy traffic of the gas pumps! Also, because the Sheetz is open 24 hours, if you get here late late late at night, you still have toilets available to you (unlike you do at strip mall locations--sorry Glen Allen!)

Tips:
- Come here for superfast charging and delicious road food to take with you on your drive.
- Head a few miles south for the Glen Allen Supercharger for sit-down restaurant service and charging at a more relaxed pace (that is less likely to get you overage charges).

10476,1367,"Now that Tesla autos are becoming more popular and there is a very active secondary market for them, the conditions at superchargers need to be addressed before they become a serious problem.  Until the pandemic is over, bathrooms need to be provided or the building nearest to them needs to have bathrooms open at all times.  Carl's Junior used to provide these services, but closed their lobby for the pandemic.  This needs to be addressed for Tesla users.  This is a huge issue and cannot go unaddressed for much longer before it starts to become a public health issue.  The second, connected issue is trash.  Even if you buy food from Carl's Junior, they do not have trash cans you can use.  This causes some people to feel free to throw their trash in the ground in and around the superchargers, giving them a very second rate feeling.  Tesla could easily address these issues by reminding CJ's how much money they make off of Tesla owners and to give some back by re-opening their restrooms for Tesla owners and providing trash services for Tesla owners.

There were only 3 of the 4 stations working and one guy sat on hold with Electrify America the entire time trying to get assistance.

9002,4256,"Supercharger near Ocean City Maryland on Rt. US 50 just before the bridge into Ocean City. It's conveniently located at a Royal Farms. As you can see from the pictures, at first the electrons were flowing very fast. When I had only sixty miles of charge, the battery was accepting nearly 500 miles of range per hour of charge. If only it had stayed like that, but no. It didn't.

As the amount of charge increased, the rate of charge decreased. I'm told that this is what happens at all supercharging stations. By the time I got to 80%, my rate of charge dropped to 146 miles of range per hour of charge. By the time I was closing in on 90%, my rate of charge was around 100 miles of range per hour of charge. Clearly, the best strategy for long trips is to keep the battery below 80% because recharging above that takes a long time. This works only if charging stations are very close to the route and reasonably close to each other.

Another trip to O.C. Different charge stall than before. Still works the same way. My strategy, when spending a weekend in Ocean City, is to top up the Tesla right before driving into O.C.

There still is the Fish Camp superchargers closer to Yosemite but the Tesla supercharger network keeps expanding to rural areas and are popping up in more areas than any other EV charging network including places like Oakhurst. 5 stars just for putting a supercharger in a location I never thought I would see one in 😁👍. Now where are all the other EV DC fast chargers for non-Teslas? Gotta catch up other companies 😉,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

1636,788,"Fantastic & a VERY CONVENIENT location!!  As with most Tesla superchargers stations, they’re primarily located on interstates & typically near next truckstops and small hotels.  For those traveling on “the 10/20,” this provides a good midpoint, particularly if you’re driving long distance. Of course, there are other MULTIPLE stations (plural) whether driving East or West: b/t Midland and Dallas, -OR- Midland and El Paso.  While I have certainly no complaints about this “standard 8 charging ports” station, the only “con“ that is applicable is that while road improvements are certainly a good thing, the city of Midland is currently doing extensive road construction at this intersection & for a very, very long time. The last few times I’ve been here, this relatively important intersection has been continually down to ‘ONE LANE’ in ALL directions so allow for a little more time going “to & fro.”  Additionally, it would be nice if TESLA had a station in Odessa on 20 as well but such has yet to be implemented.  However, a Tesla technician tell me, roughly 4 & 1/2 yrs ago - that Midland actually had this Tesla supercharger station installed ”early in” -  [even] B4 San Antonio ever had ONE (U can imagine the bureaucratic “red tape” involved in any EV installation) of these convenient stations due to many factors….so this speaks well of the city of Midlands willingness for innovation & growth!

Little Info:
“Very Versed” in EVs (I’ve been the owner of 4 EVs since 2013 - 2023; a decade).  IF U have ANY questions in regards such (driving an EV is different in regards to an ICE vehicle, please feel free to ASK.  I might note that I am still an ardent supporter of the Oil & Gas ⛽️ industry and there are subtleties U learn in the difference b/t EVs & ICE.  Equally, I am also an ardent supporter of EV vehicles, though I will echo Elon musk‘s comments in regard to such:

“If TESLA, today (2023), tried to support the ‘needs’ of all current transportation, it could handle about 1% or so of the nation’s transportation.”
- From an interview  sry late last year.

This is, very much, still, a technology in its infancy, that, & like all forms of transportation, since the horse and buggy, will continue to evolve, though I must admit, I don’t mind skipping my gas bill of MANY yrs ago (ESP since last “ICE” vehicle in 2012 was an SUV that ang’d approx 9mpg!).!  Anyway, like all technologies, things will evolve, and people still have  a lot of questions in regards to the EV industry and I’m only happy to answer such questions after a decade of owning/driving exclusively, EV…half of that decade, owning/driving exclusively multiple Teslas.

Also of NOTE: unfortunately, there are people who, dislike the EV industry, primarily out of fear and misinformation. It’s unfortunate as, in all of our lifetimes, ANYbody who is alive today, will ABSOLUTELY NOT be impacted by the EV industry as it pertains to their employment.  Those with this mindset might be wise to think 🤔 of the analogy of the original fear of automobiles when horse and buggies were the primary mode of transportation; “fear of [key word: VERY “EVENTUAL”…NOT “Overnight] CHANGE,” in essence, is what it boils down to.  Again, the EV industry will continue to grow, but for anybody alive today, it certainly will not, nay, CANNOT replace the ICE (Ice Internal Combustion engine) anytime soon; so PLEASE “put away such fears and prejudices; this industry will NEVER impact your livelihood!).  Moreover, such “haters” & naysayers should just relax, and understand that technology, no matter what industry it’s applicable to, will continue to evolve like ALL technology has since the dawn of time.  I could say much more in regards to this but as this is not the place for such discourse, those that do you have legitimate interests, again, feel free to contact me, and I am more than happy to enlighten anybody about the pros and cons of the fantastic “EV World” and help you to understand the differences as they definitely DO exist.

All in all, this charging station is among the better of the ones I've used. The location is also fairly safe. It's well-lit, in a good area, close to many businesses including a 24-hour Wal-Mart, and is easy to reach just off the 101 freeway and on Camelback.

We were visiting Austin for my husband's medical appointment at VA Clinic. EV map was showing Most fast charging stations  located near by downtown and Round Rock.

Me and my husband from west central Texas(lil over 3hrs away from Austin),and we wasn't sure where to find a fast charging station for our 2020 Kia Niro EV.

Luckily, we found this spot but EV map wasn't showing a whole lot a details. Whether it has CHAdeMO, CCS.and J1772.

Soon as we were at this location,  OMG , I see the FAST charging station and nobody wasn't using at the time. There is  only 2 fast charging tower and 1 of tower wasn't available.  Luckily next to other charging tower was work.

We used CCS charger.  Before we put on charger, we only had a 39% power left on our car. We put on charger about less than 40 minutes later, it was 90% full.

This is just reminder,  with CCS charger battery wont charging a 100%. I do not know why they capped at 90% but, yeah 90% is  max capped. It wont let you charging any further. So if you want to charge your battery for 100%, you have to switch to CHAdeMO for rest of 10%.

0.21 cents per kw, yeah, it was little higher than where my husband went to last time. (Last time he went to Walmart EV charging station and their rate was 0.12 cents per kw. And this was only about 3 or 4 month ago). I guess because it located at right by airport  that maybe the reason why its pricey on this charging station.

The trick may be that this charger appears popular.  I had 2 other drivers stop by while I was charging. The first almost arrived at the same time who needed just a few minutes and the later who arrived about 20 minutes after I connected. I ended up cutting my charge short because he felt I had enough power to get to and from work the next day. I'm not sure what the etiquette is but this felt weird.

7632,3562,"Now that I'm aware that, on the first purchase, ChargePoint charges an additional $5.00 to your credit card, I decided to add $2.25, or so (out of $2.75 credit).

After all, why should they be allowed to keep more of my money than they already are?

But, when I pulled up to the first charging station, it took me several minutes to get to the point on the app to, Start Charging. :-(

Once I got it hooked up, and going, all was going OK. Yay!

But, after a few seconds, I noticed a, Not Charging, message. :-(

So, rather than fight that station again, I moved my car to the next one.

And, finally! Got this station working, and added, $2.29 (about 12 miles) to my EV.

Now, to be honest, these public charging stations are great while traveling. However, depending on the state, regular gas vehicles can be cheaper to fill up.

But, for driving around town, and despite the long time needed to charge on a 110V outlet (12 hours gave me 45 miles. The cost? $0.84! Yes, only eightyfour cents!).

So, for gasoline/diesel vs home electric costs, EVs are a much better deal. Though, still cost prohibitive for many people (starting at around $38,000, and can exceed $250,000).

But, prices are dropping (just like the first Plasma 40"" set was $14,999.99). And, in a few years, EV prices are expected to be under $30K for the lower end models

While I am happy to be courteous of the special needs of electric car drivers, it seemed reasonable to expect that there would not be EIGHT teslas arriving after ten pm that night, in need of charging.

The next morning I found that the driver's side window of my car had been VANDALIZED by a tesla employee/representative.

Clearly, these parking spaces are being leased by tesla from the hotel, so tesla is exerting its property rights. That's fine, tesla, but HOW ABOUT POSTING A SIGN WARNING THAT YOU WILL BE VANDALIZING MY CAR IF I PARK IN YOUR PRECIOUS SPACE? Really lousy corporate citizenship; but who among us is surprised by this behavior from tesla? You'd think that a company with so much expensive equipment sitting un-monitored at thousands of locations around the country would be careful about promoting vandalism. Yes, I parked in your precious parking space, tesla; but you went completely Putinesque with your response.

To be more precise: those parking spaces are not parking spaces: they are charging spaces. Even a tesla owner may not park there for FIVE MINUTES after the conclusion of charging, or tesla will start billing their account a trespassing fee. I cannot make this stuff up: go to their website for confirmation. Now, on top of having my car vandalized by this corporate miscreant, I feel the need to count myself fortunate that i was not also charged a trespassing fee.

In Teslaworld, there are two kinds of customer: tesla owners; and The Enemy. And even tesla owners must remain on their best behavior, or face punishment. I can only imagine that the rest of the tesla customer relationship must be quite self-affirming for low self-esteem Masochists.

The only think that makes me nervous is that two of the stations have lots of pooling water from a nearby sprinkler.

Be aware that, not only does ChargePoint charges an additional $5.00 on your credit card on the first purchase (my bill was $22.75 (01:29:00 + 00:01:00 idle time to disconnect ;-(  ) CP made 2 charges; 1 for $10 00 + 1 for $20.00), but depending on the state, they can bill either by the kWh used. Or, by the minute (much more expensive).

Now that I'm aware of CP charging an additional $5.00, I decided to add $2.25, or so (out of $2.75 credit).

After all, why should they be allowed to keep more of my money than they already are?

But, when I pulled up to the first charging station, it took me several minutes to get to the point on the app to, Start Charging. :-(

Once I got it hooked up, and going, all was going OK. Yay!

But, after a few seconds, I noticed a, Not Charging, message. :-(

So, rather than fight that station again, I moved my car to the next one.

And, finally! Got this station working, and added, $2.29 (about 12 miles) to the my EV.

Now, to be honest, these public charging stations are great while traveling. However, depending on the state, regular gas vehicles can be cheaper to fill up.

But, for driving around town, and despite the long time needed to charge on a 110V outlet (12 hours gave me 45 miles. The cost? $0.84! Yes, only eightyfour cents!).

So, for gas vs home electric costs, EVs are a much better deal. Though, still cost prohibitive for many people (starting at around $38,000, and can exceed $250,000).

But, prices are dropping (just like the first Plasma 40"" set was $14,999.99). And, in a few years, EV prices are expected to be under $30K for the lower end models

Curious why they would have cones stacked and not used, for the apparent purpose of leaving these parking spots vacant. When I called to inquire about my situation, I was told that the cords reach up to four parking spaces. I am not disagreeing with this, as I have not put this to the test, but it seemed within reason, however; all four spots were taken on two occasion, by non-Tesla vehicles (or any EV for that matter). I was also told the hotel was at capacity; at capacity did not seem sufficient enough when there was about 10 parkings available. I get the fact that the parking for destination charging was slightly closer than the vacant parkings, due to all rooms being booked. If people are booking rooms, whether it be personal or business, I would think that those who have limited resources for tier 2 charging in Sierra Vista would get some preference over someone who wants to park 10-20 feet closer to the hotel, when there is a gas station less than a 1/2 mile away.

The credit card reader has a tap-and-pay option but it always failed for me on different credit cards without giving a reason. Only when you slide in the credit card with the chip did the payment go through. I also had trouble with some stations (""charging error"") so I had to repark the car to try a different one.

After payment is authorized, charging starts and you have the option to leave a phone number for charging updates or download the app. I was able to get a throughput of 44kW but to be fair I also had a high state of charge. Once charging is complete or you stop charging, the card is then charged.

Which is a nice touch but the hose is not long enough to reach other side of your vehicle with out moving your vehicle more then once to reach all 4 tires.,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

[TIP: If you're coming off I-40, take the Right at the Embassy Suites hotel sign (Harrison Oaks Blvd) , then take the first Left, then turn Right after the Mr. Tire Auto center and you're there.

Nothing will make the charging time disappear like wandering the aisles thinking about what you can buy for your next hunting/fishing/camping trip. And they tend to keep pretty clean bathrooms as well.

My limited experience with commercial chargers is that they tend to have pricing equivalent to the price of gasoline...even though the electric cost is far less. How do they get away with it? Well, they're aimed (especially these Tesla chargers) at transient vehicles, those who can't simply go home and plug it in (at a fraction of the cost). Captives.

This supercharging station works great. However, it is the only one that serves the North Houston area  on I45 (the woodlands, spring,Conroe) and is not enough. Lately, I have found it is pretty packed and have to wait for 3 or 4 vehicles ahead of me.  Each vehicle takes at the very least 20 min, that is a minimum of 1 hr to be able to use it.  Also don’t understand why other non-EV vehicles are allowed to circulate in and out through the stations.

I have 3 years of free EA 30 minute charging with my new 2023 Genesis GV60 which was delivered to my house last night.  I live about 1.5 miles from IKEA Ct, so went over there this morning to charge the Genesis.  YIKES! One charger is down and the other two kept ""interrupted charging"" messages after about 30 seconds of starting.  TOTALLY useless and spent almost an HOUR trying to get even a token charge and THAT NEVER HAPPENED.
