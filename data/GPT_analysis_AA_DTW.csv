We rented a tesla to take my husband to the internment in Holly.  We had to reschedule because we couldn't make it there. Thank goodness for the charging station.   We made it home because of the charging station.Want to laugh? Read the poor reviews for this location. It's hilarious. Obviously five stars! It's hard to find a Tesla charging location that's not five stars. When they exist, it's because they're not enough amenities, it's a long walk, etc... But almost never legit complaints that they didn't work.Tried 2 chargers when 17deg F, and both were frozen. Got nervous because I was at 5% with no other charging option available on Christmas day. Fortunately the 3rd charger worked. Images are of the chargers and plugs that didn't work. Not sure how to report this to Tesla.Great location. This was close to I-75 highway. There is a Meijer grocery store and Target w/ a Starbucks close by.  There is also an Olive Garden that is a few minutes walk down the parking lot.These chargers are in great shape and conveniently located between a giant Meijer and Target so you can burn time. There are plenty of stations and often has a few open. Most of the other tesla drivers seem to be pretty cool. It becomes like a car meet",4.4
