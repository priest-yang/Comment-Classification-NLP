After all, why should they be allowed to keep more of my money than they already are?  But, when I pulled up to the first charging station, it took me several minutes to get to the point on the app to, Start Charging. :-(  Once I got it hooked up, and going, all was going OK. Yay!  But, after a few seconds, I noticed a, Not Charging, message. :-(  So, rather than fight that station again, I moved my car to the next one.  And, finally! Got this station working, and added, $2.29 (about 12 miles) to my EV.  Now, to be honest, these public charging stations are great while traveling. However, depending on the state, regular gas vehicles can be cheaper to fill up.  But, for driving around town, and despite the long time needed to charge on a 110V outlet (12 hours gave me 45 miles. The cost? $0.84! Yes, only eightyfour cents!).  So, for gasoline/diesel vs home electric costs, EVs are a much better deal. Though, still cost prohibitive for many people (starting at around $38,000, and can exceed $250,000).  But, prices are dropping (just like the first Plasma 40"" set was $14,999.99). And, in a few years, EV prices are expected to be under $30K for the lower end models  My EV recommends leaving it plugged in.

The app PlugShare has been a lifesaver for finding alternatives and is very user friendly. The chargepoint charger by tofurkey hq is a much better option.  The phone call required to start up Webasto stations as a non-member tends to take a full 10 minutes every time - other brands‚Äô stations (blink, chargepoint, Volta) do not require a call to start, so having to call and wait on hold seems like a pretty unnecessary hassle.  Webasto are also the only brand of chargers that has been unreliable for me - today, this charger did not work, and I had one instance elsewhere where the charger inexplicably timed out. In both cases, calling customer service to troubleshoot was pretty frustrating - today, the rep insisted the problem was my car and not the station, even though 2 other brands of stations had worked for me in the past day. Immediately after our call I drove to a chargepoint station which worked successfully, so I followed up and informed Webasto that the problem was indeed their charger, not my car.  I am hoping Webasto addresses this issue - this location is so convenient and I‚Äôd love to charge here.

Columbus received a total of $50 million in the form of two grants, $40 million from USDOT and $10 million from Vulcan, Inc., a Paul Allen company. These dollars provide the seed funding for Smart Columbus, a region-wide Smart City initiative co-led by the City of Columbus and Columbus Partnership.  The City of Columbus, under the leadership of Mayor Andrew J. Ginther, is the lead recipient of the $50 million and will administer the deployment of these funds for the duration of the grant period, which concludes at the end of 2020.  The Columbus Partnership, representing the Columbus Region‚Äôs private sector, is the lead implementation partner for the grant program and is responsible for the initiative‚Äôs Acceleration Fund, which is credited as a significant factor in Columbus‚Äô winning of the challenge.

The landscaping is actually one of my favorite things about the Cannery District - it is unusual in that it uses a lot of native and drought tolerant plants that provide something interesting to look at every month of the year - far more beneficial to wildlife and aesthetically pleasing than the usual boring river rock and homogenous row of bushes that you see everywhere.

Good spotNow that Tesla autos are becoming more popular and there is a very active secondary market for them, the conditions at superchargers need to be addressed before they become a serious problem.  Until the pandemic is over, bathrooms need to be provided or the building nearest to them needs to have bathrooms open at all times.  Carl's Junior used to provide these services, but closed their lobby for the pandemic.  This needs to be addressed for Tesla users.  This is a huge issue and cannot go unaddressed for much longer before it starts to become a public health issue.  The second, connected issue is trash.  Even if you buy food from Carl's Junior, they do not have trash cans you can use.  This causes some people to feel free to throw their trash in the ground in and around the superchargers, giving them a very second rate feeling.  Tesla could easily address these issues by reminding CJ's how much money they make off of Tesla owners and to give some back by re-opening their restrooms for Tesla owners and providing trash services for Tesla owners.  It's not cool at all that CJ's has taken this stance, given how many superchargers are near CJ restaurants.Charging started at 113kw (I was in stall 2A). It's always good to see a high rate.

Location is excellent as hotel is right off the highway, the guy at the hotel gate didn‚Äôt even ask if I had reservation, lol, he said buenos dias and activated up the arm to get in, pretty sure they just know we‚Äôre charging! Now the thing that sucks is the ramp up to get to the chargers, it‚Äôs super steep so the bumper touched a bit and at the top even going sideways It touched the bottom of the car. Just be careful and go slow and see which side is less steep. Fast chargers!One of the worst charging stations of Tesla. One to two chargers are always broken and 2 of the stations have charging speed of less than 30 miles per hour. Considering the city size Tesla should offer more stations and better speed. The average speed of charging is between 58-90 miles per hour (if you are luckky). We commute from San Diego to Phoenix quite frequently.  The estimate provided by Tesla Maps always turn out incorrect because charging at Yuma always takes more than 1 hour 30 mins compared to suggested charging time of 35 minutes. Please avoid long weekend. We once had to wait for more than 3 hours for our turn to charge and when we finally got our turn, the charging was available at 58 miles per hour which went down to 29 miles per hour. We had to sit there was more than 2.5 hours. There's nothing available closeby. The hotel next to the charging station keeps the door closed for Tesla customers ( may be their policy). We went looking for a restroom and nothing was available nearby. The most pathetic Tesla chargers I have seen so far. Tesla seriously need to upgraded these from 150 to 250kwUPDATE: 10/17 Ok. Location has gotten worse. Charge speed was 54kWh and one charger out of commission. You have to talk to the hotel for the bathroom and restaurant was closed until 5pm at the Hilton. Personally I‚Äôd avoid this place going forward on my trips from AZ to CA. Sorry but I‚Äôm not taking the 3:10 to Yuma anymore. üòâ  Original Post: This location was ‚Äúok‚Äù. Like many of the other reviews not the best ‚Äúspot‚Äù with amenities, access to bathroom, food, etc‚Ä¶ but I was a bit nervous about the charge rate and some people stated it was horrible. So I‚Äôm only charging at 1 unit, the last one on the left when facing the chargers unit 4B and it‚Äôs not that bad.  It‚Äôs giving me a good 110kW for about 450mil/hr. Not the best but not the worst. The location otherwise at 9pm is well lit and doesn‚Äôt seem unsafe. Good pit stop between Tucson and San Diego. 2 stars loss for lack of amenities.Same feedback as other people; no food nearby, no bathrooms and location feels like a destination charger next to a hotel. Charging speeds were ok and so far everything was functional. If you can, plan on stopping at the Fortuna Rd one (by Frys) a few miles away.I've had my 2020 model 3 for 3 months now. This super charging location seems to be rated low for several reasons. All I can say is that I'm thankful charging station 3B works. Most superchargers like this work much faster than 86-87 kW. This seemed pretty slow, especially for 9:30pm at night. With my two photos, you can kinda get a view of the area around the charger. I see several buildings under construction. This charging station will probably be better in a few years when this area finishes developing. But as for now, it feels a little sketchy after dark. As several other reviews suggest, I would also recommend skipping this charging location and going straight from Gila Bend to El Centro. Both of those locations provide better options than just sitting in your car... not that sitting in a Tesla is EVER boring! Haha",2.6

There is no overhead cover against rain and sun, and nothing above eye-level to indicate where in the parking lot the chargers are located.

The rightmost two parking spots are the most convenient - they back onto an aisle between rows of cars, while the two spots on the left are across from a curb and row of cars, which gives you less space to back out.  The Folsom Premium Outlets are convenient if you are traveling Highway 50, less so if you need to get back onto I-80.

Based on other reviews, I was a little worried about slow charging speeds but I got ~140kw the entire time, even with 3-4 other cars there.  We had a hitch mounted carrier and were able to back in and still reach the charging cable. There were two chargers that you could use even if you had a trailer attached. Also, the hotel attendant didn't even question us when we went inside looking for restrooms.  So I think overall a good spot. As always, more amenities like food/snacks would be better, but I think from a family perspective this one is pretty great. I could imagine even letting kids run around inside the hotel lobby on bad weather days.Tesla map says it's 250 kW but the charging speed is hardly 40kW at 110 mi/hr that's too slow.Six chargers in total, easy to find using Tesla GPS. Tesla employee was here fixing a supercharger while I charged. They maintain them well.Slow charging from 2A. Moved to 3B and got much better result.  Also the new four chargers charge slower that the gen1 chargers.  Not sure why . . .",3.4

Your best bet is to get on I-25 north and get off on the first exit about 2 miles down then cross the bridge and head south. It's absolutely absurd.  Why 3 stars?  Cons: There is only one charger suitable for anyone that has anything hitch mounted (hitch rack or trailer). We had a hitch mounted carrier with an ice chest on it, and even backing all the way up against the chargers, the cable didn't reach. So our only options were: park sideways and block a bunch of stalls OR remove the hitch rack. Luckily when we got there nearly all the chargers were empty but right when we finished charging, literally about 8 Teslas pulled in and we looked like the most inconsiderate Tesla owners on the planet for about 5 mins.

I stay in my car as I'm not comfortable going into a hotel to use their restrooms. Or walk 15 min to the nearest grocery store, coffee shop or restaurant! This would've been best if in the Whole Foods parking lot or the shopping complex across the street. It takes longer to charge (150kwh) at this location. It's always full or couple of them out of service. Also, it's surrounded by bushes and in the back of the hotel parking lot ... safety concern at night. Desperately needed one on Greenville, hence the 3 star.Try to avoid using unless have no time to charge at home. Usually full so slower charging, some stations not working causing confusion with in/out versus moving to working charger. In a rather secluded area of hotel Parking lot which I would not feel comfortable using alone at night. I could understand if this was just a remote highway stop but there are so many shopping complexes in Greenville located right off highway more convenient as this site. Don‚Äôt expect a quick stop unless off hours.Heads up, this is a small site in a hotel parking lot.  So not that many chargers.  You turn at the Hilton Garden Inn entrance, not before.  Also, there is no food or easy bathroom close by.  You can use Hilton lobby bathroom, I think.  There is a Whole Foods across a busy street and a bit of a hike.  I only come here because my family lives nearby, otherwise I would choose a different location that has a convenience store.It is in a hotel parking lot like most reviews say but they do have restrooms inside the hotel. I walked right in and used it with no problems at all. When you walk in you see the snacks and stuff in front, head to the right of that and they are right there. Pretty hard to miss. No food or anything that close so that's a huge bummer and the superchargers are busy alot of the time which is a bummer considering it is a V2 supercharger which means you share power with your neighbor (1a shares with 1b, 2a with 2b and so on). It has also told me that all but one charger is available until I pull into the parking lot then it has told me two available and one of the two was broken.Great spot.

As for charging when we were low on battery we were able to hit about 116kW so we had no issues with the actual charging.  Overall, I think that having the chargers further out into the parking lot is a better solution to prevent other cars from parking in the spots.5 stars for the supercharger, 1 star for the locals that love to block access with their ICE vehicles.

IF U have ANY questions in regards such (driving an EV is different in regards to an ICE vehicle, please feel free to ASK.  I might note that I am still an ardent supporter of the Oil & Gas ‚õΩÔ∏è industry and there are subtleties U learn in the difference b/t EVs & ICE.  Equally, I am also an ardent supporter of EV vehicles, though I will echo Elon musk‚Äòs comments in regard to such:  ‚ÄúIf TESLA, today (2023), tried to support the ‚Äòneeds‚Äô of all current transportation, it could handle about 1% or so of the nation‚Äôs transportation.‚Äù - From an interview  sry late last year.  This is, very much, still, a technology in its infancy, that, & like all forms of transportation, since the horse and buggy, will continue to evolve, though I must admit, I don‚Äôt mind skipping my gas bill of MANY yrs ago (ESP since last ‚ÄúICE‚Äù vehicle in 2012 was an SUV that ang‚Äôd approx 9mpg!).!  Anyway, like all technologies, things will evolve, and people still have  a lot of questions in regards to the EV industry and I‚Äôm only happy to answer such questions after a decade of owning/driving exclusively, EV‚Ä¶half of that decade, owning/driving exclusively multiple Teslas.  Also of NOTE: unfortunately, there are people who, dislike the EV industry, primarily out of fear and misinformation. It‚Äôs unfortunate as, in all of our lifetimes, ANYbody who is alive today, will ABSOLUTELY NOT be impacted by the EV industry as it pertains to their employment.  Those with this mindset might be wise to think ü§î of the analogy of the original fear of automobiles when horse and buggies were the primary mode of transportation; ‚Äúfear of [key word: VERY ‚ÄúEVENTUAL‚Äù‚Ä¶NOT ‚ÄúOvernight] CHANGE,‚Äù in essence, is what it boils down to.  Again, the EV industry will continue to grow, but for anybody alive today, it certainly will not, nay, CANNOT replace the ICE (Ice Internal Combustion engine) anytime soon; so PLEASE ‚Äúput away such fears and prejudices; this industry will NEVER impact your livelihood!).  Moreover, such ‚Äúhaters‚Äù & naysayers should just relax, and understand that technology, no matter what industry it‚Äôs applicable to, will continue to evolve like ALL technology has since the dawn of time.  I could say much more in regards to this but as this is not the place for such discourse, those that do you have legitimate interests, again, feel free to contact me, and I am more than happy to enlighten anybody about the pros and cons of the fantastic ‚ÄúEV World‚Äù and help you to understand the differences as they definitely DO exist.

Even a tesla owner may not park there for FIVE MINUTES after the conclusion of charging, or tesla will start billing their account a trespassing fee. I cannot make this stuff up: go to their website for confirmation. Now, on top of having my car vandalized by this corporate miscreant, I feel the need to count myself fortunate that i was not also charged a trespassing fee.  In Teslaworld, there are two kinds of customer: tesla owners; and The Enemy. And even tesla owners must remain on their best behavior, or face punishment.

But the way to get around that would be to make an   $8 or more purchase from the MOMs Organic Market above the garage, get your ticket validated for 2hrs of free parking and your supercharge session will be ""free"". Only gripe was that there were 2 non Tesla‚Äôs parked in the Tesla spot for what looked like a prolonged period of time so the 7 Tesla spots were actually 5 available spots and I would never of known that from the Tesla navigation system that tells me how many spots are open.Be advised this is in a paid parking lot.

Usually blocked by other non EV cars.I‚Äôve been trying to stay at this hotel, as it has 2 Tesla destination chargers, however; I have driven by on several occasions, only to find that these parking spots have been taken. I noticed neon traffic cones adjacent to the chargers (not in the actual parking space), and the chargers are locked (I‚Äôm ok with this, as they have a sign stating, guests are to ask personnel to unlock for charging. Curious why they would have cones stacked and not used, for the apparent purpose of leaving these parking spots vacant. When I called to inquire about my situation, I was told that the cords reach up to four parking spaces. I am not disagreeing with this, as I have not put this to the test, but it seemed within reason, however; all four spots were taken on two occasion, by non-Tesla vehicles (or any EV for that matter). I was also told the hotel was at capacity; at capacity did not seem sufficient enough when there was about 10 parkings available. I get the fact that the parking for destination charging was slightly closer than the vacant parkings, due to all rooms being booked. If people are booking rooms, whether it be personal or business, I would think that those who have limited resources for tier 2 charging in Sierra Vista would get some preference over someone who wants to park 10-20 feet closer to the hotel, when there is a gas station less than a 1/2 mile away.  The individual Monica was very pleasant and understanding on the phone.  Not sure if this hotel gets make and model color when checking in; This could easily remedy the situation by contacting the guests at some point. Using the cones would be my first option though‚Ä¶Yeah only for guests.

We had to stand in line for the buffet to wait for tables to open up. They had a sign up explaining they were short staffed like so many other places, which I understand.  There was one long table with Reserved signs on it that nobody ever sat at - I am thinking that was probably related to short staffing and trying to keep up. I don't eat meat so I asked if I could order the kids grilled cheese and fries, which they were nice enough to let me. I was actually surprised how fast my meal came considering, and it was hot and fresh. My husband had the buffet for $25 because he has always been about quantity over quality.  When he left food on his plate and only made two trips through,  you know it's BAD! He said the selection was way down from when he has been there in previous years. He said the food was just gross. He admitted my idea of picking up pizza in Mandan would have been much better.  We did wander around the casino area for a little while before and after the concert.  The layout is not crowd friendly, as there are so many machines jam packed in there that you add a few people and there is not much room to move.  I thought the concert hall was extremely warm, and I am the one that is always cold, so it had to have been bad! Our seats were right under a light on the side wall, which glared in our eyes and made it hard to watch people coming and going while we waited for the concert to begin.",2.0

Not Tesla. Which is ok, everyone should probably carry an adapter to connect to either one. $3/hour is not the best price, but the charger seems fast. Required downloading a new app (to me at least) called AmpUp. An old-fashioned gasoline f150 was parked in the spot, but the cord is long enough to reach me in the next spot over. There is also a NEMA 14-50r four prong plug. That one appears to be free(!?) for hotel guests.Does not exist anymore! The Tesla destination chargers were replaced with JuiceBar chargers that use AmpUp to charge you. They have J1772 plugs and charge at 10kW. The current rate is $3/hour plus taxes, fees, and idle fees ($5/hour starting 30 minutes after charging finishes). Max allowed charging time is 4 hours. Then you have to go unplug and plug back in to start a new session. The NEMA 14-50 and NEMA 5-20 (120v) outlets are still there if you have your UMC on you. The two times I used the 14-50 outlets, I had to turn on the circuit breakers in the breaker panel not too far away. There are three charger plugs and three outlets of each that reach four parking spaces, although a couple of spots were usually ICE‚Äôd. I recommend bringing your J1772 adapter if you plan to use the charger, and also bringing your Mobile Connector with a 14-50 adapter if you don‚Äôt feel like going through the trouble of dealing with AmpUp and needing to reconnect after 4 hours.At this time only one charger works and it‚Äôs always a gamble for a spot due to ICE vehicles parking there.Nice family stay at the HGI.

I'd give it 5 stars except for: A: It's up a long, steep mountain road, so it'll eat a lot of juice just getting here from Winthrop. B: The resort has a strict No Dogs policy, so we never stay there. Great place for hiking in the summer, and XC skiing in the winter. Great views.My Wife and I drove our Telsa Model Y over for a weekend stay and had good luck with the charging station provided by Sun Mountain Lodge. There are two Tesla level 2 chargers and one non-Tesla - the Tesla chargers that we used operated at 48A at 208V. We left our car charging several times while eating at one of the restaurants or out hiking. We were able to add enough range to drive around for the weekend and to make it back home in Bothell without having to stop.This is the only Tesla charging available in hundred miles radius and it didn't work for me during the Labor Day weekend (2020). I left supercharger at Burlington, WA with full charge (280 miles worth), Winthrop is 140 miles one-way, so it was a tight roundtrip with no room for error; so I visited this destination charger hoping to add 30 miles for safety. Neither of the 2 Tesla chargers worked (the charging port glowed red, and the panel said 'charging equipment fault'). The faculty at the lodge tried to reset the chargers a couple of times, but that didn't change anything.  First, the destination chargers are at the top of a mountain that's 12 miles from Winthrop, but takes 25 miles worth of battery to reach from Winthrop -- so, when you go there and the charger doesn't work, you've now wasted 25-30 miles of battery to make that trip up the hill and in vain. No one at the lodge can tell you either upfront if the chargers work or otherwise -- they won't know.  There's a third non-Tesla charger; but beware it's a 30A charger, which will charge about 17miles per hour at best.  I suggest - don't bother with this charging option unless you have a 10kWh buffer to gamble with. Instead, your best bets are some of the camping grounds (KOA for example) that lets you use 50A plugs for 5-6 hours in RV camping slots for $20 or so (of course you'd need your charging cable & adapters). In fact, the entire SR-20 stretch is a terrible idea with a Tesla right now -- until Tesla installs a supercharger in Winthrop. Hope they do soon -- it's one of the popular routes for camping/vacationing.",3.3333333333333335

Gas station is nice and convenient and they have a diner on the inside. Great nature area to walk around in to get some fresh air and stretch your legs.This is a very good location with a nice convenience store nearby. But in early March of 2023 they are doing work on it and have units tagged out as unsafe. This is not the case. My model 3 did not alert me that these were tagged out. Another driver was already there and told me their car was charging despite the unsafe warning. Tesla needs to address this as the tags were placed on February 27th, 2023 more than one week ago. Get this cleaned up.This a relatively new Supercharger as in existed in January 2020, but the convenience store and truck stop didn't open at this location until March 2020.  There's a small park with some sculpture behind the chargers. It's nice, at least in summer. The truck stop/gas station is clean inside, plus there's a little Cafe inside with sit down space.Next to the cutest gosh darn park this side of the Mississippi. In case it gets busy, there are plenty of benches to choose from. The water fountain was overly aggressive but balanced by the tranquil environment provided by the resident styrofoam deer. Favorite station yet. I wish I could give it 6 stars because there was no Arby‚Äôs in sight. Who even goes there?Fast charging and always availability. Right off the interstate. The Quick Pik has been recently remodeled and has new owners. The bathrooms are usually clean and there are normal convenience store items as well as a sit down restaurant which also features Godfather's Pizza. Haven't had a chance to eat here since Covid-19 hit, but when they were located across the street the food was decent and kinda like an old style diner. One of the cool things about this location is there is a park right next to the Superchargers where you can walk, sit and relax or have a picnic. There are several benches and a gazebo to get out of the sun.

After multiple chats and calls and hours with Tesla and they suggested third party chargers so went to the closest one available. (In the meantime Tesla has marked the supercharge as ‚Äúunder planned maintenance‚Äù for a week.) The ChargePoint charger we went to was a 7 kW charger. After another hour with Tesla to arrange a tow to a faster charger they mentioned that this has to be paid out of pocket and not covered by Tesla. When explained the fact that this was a problem with the supercharger and not the car they mentioned that it might happen that the supercharger would not work at times. Which basically means that the superchargers are unreliable as well and if you‚Äôre stuck like us get ready to spend out of your own pocket for a tow. Also after the tow even if you reach the next supercharger there is no guarantee that the super chargers will work. It might be in the same situation as this one ( while on the chat with Tesla they could see that 2 of the stalls were not working but all others were working which was clearly not the case when we reached. There was another model 3 which faced the same issue). Sorry for the long review but be careful specially if you‚Äôre traveling with family and small kids in winter.Horrible.

Now Nationwide General Contracting is here every time I come! They park the Tesla, put out business cards and leave! How do the businesses get away with leaving a Tesla at a charging station? What about idle fees? Frustrating because this is a very busy charging station any way!Busy, high usage, one station told me there was an error so I had to move.  Many stations, only maybe 3 or 4 free.  There is not enough east Orlando superchargers tbh,.so check availability before you head there.Older charger so the units share power in pairs. If possible charge at a number that no one else is at. For instance, if someone is at 2B don't use 2A as it will take twice as long for each of you to charge. Go to whichever number doesn't have some at either paired stallGood place, but it's often busy. Good options are available for time passes.Great location next to a friendly social bar and grill and an awesome mall. A few minutes from 408 and further to I-4.

EV friendly organic eco-conscious hippies. :) Pretty sure most people here are coming in or out of Teton/Yellowstone.Nice super charger. Whole Foods is always clean and has good stuff. Well lit.  Only negative is other cars will sometimes park in spotsFour of the eight stations had non-EVs occupying them when we got there. Closer inspection showed that 30 minute general parking is allowed for alternate stalls, but while we were charging (7/11/22), the store updated signage such that all eight superchargers are allowed for 30 minute general parking. So basically, you can't trust the number of open stalls indicated by app or nav system. Tesla should consider finding a more reliable location in Jackson. It's a busy parking lot and forming a line is not a good option. If you need to use it, off hours are likely advisable.I was getting range anxiety as we got closer to the super charger and I was worried about finding a spot and about how fast it would charge because of the previous reviews. Fortunately we found a spot. It charged quickly and it was a good experience. I took 1 start off though because as mentioned in other reviews there are more non electric cars parked here than those that need it. There were plenty of normal spots open but apparently they all prefer the Tesla parking. 1 guy parked here and then went into the apartments behind the store. Lame.Seconding what others have said about this location. I was in Jackson for a week and probably used this charging station 10x. Out of those 10x, there was a gas truck parked in a Tesla spot about 30% of the time, which is lame considering there were plenty of open general parking spots at the time.  Otherwise the location is great - just outside the town square, in a Whole Foods parking lot, and a very short walk to Cowboy Coffee where you can get coffee, tea, drinks, snacks and burritos.",3.8

There is always more than one charge station that is either offline, the screen frozen or just downright not working at all. When you finally find an open spot that works you get very slow charging current more often than not. I've had times where my EV doesn't charge more than 15% after being plugged in for more than 30 minutes. with more and more EVs out there it is becoming increasingly difficult to find on open spot and there is always someone that leaves their car plugged in after their session is over (coincidently is almost always the Chevy EV Bolts for some reason). With the increased EV demand, we need more stations within the 610 loop  and better service and quality of maintenance to ensure all stations are properly working.I dunno how I am supposed to like those Electrify charging stations. Parked next to one of them, - message ""out of service"". If it is out of service, - make some red light maybe? Huh? Another one doesn't have screen working. When I finally reparked twice, - I started charging. But instead of usual 130kw I got only 64. Be aware, - this location has power limit and when all the stalls are busy, - you will get longer times to charge.There's only 3 chargers that work. Lots of angry entitled people come here that will unplug your vehicle even if you're inside of it! I really think someone will get seriously hurt if they keep that up. Chargers are usually on the slow side and are frequently set to lower charging speeds due to over utilization.

Picked up our account on the car and initiated charge with no problem.  (Green charger)From my experience of using chargers, you may need to try a few times before you can charge... that said, Electrify America always has a working charger and I can charge and go without any problems. I charged my Chevy Bolt in Scipio and Ceder City during a trip from northern Utah to St George. It worked great and I had only minor problems of having to try a few times. I'd give 4.5 stars because of that, but otherwise it's so cool to have a working infrastructure for EVs.  At the time of this review, the total cost was just shy of $30 for two 50 minute stops. And I really didn't need to stop for 50 minutes in Ceder City, just chose to top up to 80% since I was there. The Electrify America chargers are much more capable than the 50 minutes I needed to charge, because of the car's limitations. The Bolt is a slow charging vehicle compared to other EVs in the same price range. I used 150 kw chargers and my car can only do 50 kw.

We spent the majority of the time trying and trying again the browser app to get to payment without timing out. The site itself seems to have been created in Italy where the creators assume you are located. The app didn‚Äôt work at all unless the charger was plugged in, however the instructions state differently.  If you absolutely need to use this one, here is what you should do. 1. Start with the charger plugged into your car. Scan the CR code on the charger. 2. Follow the prompts but make sure you adjust your address from Italy to US. Also make sure you use your billing address for the credit card you plan to use. The site will take about 30 seconds to load each step. 3. There are several screens where you will need to enter your information. 4. You will need to attempt this process several times because if you get a timeout message throughout any of the steps, you will have to start over from scratch. Trying to get back to where you were will be fruitless. 5. Finally, at the end, you will get a message warning you that the car is not plugged in and you have 60 seconds to do so. The car should already be plugged in and beginning to charge. Do not remove the charger from the car or you will have to start at the beginning.  Good luck!This was a life saver, TAOS city has no TESLA chargers or any EV chargers for that matter. The one shown in TESLA app are either closed or unavailable for general public.

I've been driving past them for months --most of a year-- and have never seen any cars using them. None of the pictures in these reviews show any cars, either.  Saw an interesting article recently about Tesla chargers. California passed a law requiring that chargers display the cost of charging, along with other info you might expect on a gas pump. Tesla chargers have no such displays...yet. Not in CA, not here, either.  My limited experience with commercial chargers is that they tend to have pricing equivalent to the price of gasoline...even though the electric cost is far less. How do they get away with it? Well, they're aimed (especially these Tesla chargers) at transient vehicles, those who can't simply go home and plug it in (at a fraction of the cost). Captives. No wonder there is no display to tell you how much your ""fuel"" is costing!  Pretty, though. And plenty of space for your car!  2023 update: three years later, there are now cars using the chargers.Excellent location - 5 minute walk to many restaurants and shops. This fills a much needed supercharging gap that existed in the Finger Lakes region.Great location, high power (150 kw, so our model S was drawing 120 kw, but that will vary based upon your state of charge)... not too busy, 5/5 would charge again.  Update, May 2021: Now that Trader Joe's has opened right by the supercharger, it is even better.Fabulous supercharge service- just to comment on cost- it‚Äôs CHEAP! $6-$8 typically and the fee shows up instantly on my cell phone/credit card charge. Ted also commented that he never sees any cars there- (a waste?) but that‚Äôs probably because it takes only 10-15 minutes to charge up! A quickie: in and out.

I highly recommend utilizing this station as a ""get some errands done"" station.As a local Emeryville resident, charging here was AMAZING before the Bay became over saturated with Teslas. I only charge during off peak hours, usually a rate of $.23 kWh but has been $.45 - $.48 kWh for at least a month now!!

I was worried it wasn't in service with the UI in our vehicle stating it was operating at reduced service.  So far I've used two different chargers and they both worked as expected.  This station is so new that it doesn't even have labels yet as of September 5th, 2020.  6 stalls. I'm assuming it's going to be A and B stalls adjacent to each other (like the newer stations have).  Update (7/Sept/2020): 2nd charger from right keeps malfunctioning when trying to latch. All others are in working order as of this update.Supercharger near Ocean City Maryland on Rt. US 50 just before the bridge into Ocean City. It's conveniently located at a Royal Farms. As you can see from the pictures, at first the electrons were flowing very fast. When I had only sixty miles of charge, the battery was accepting nearly 500 miles of range per hour of charge. If only it had stayed like that, but no. It didn't.  As the amount of charge increased, the rate of charge decreased. I'm told that this is what happens at all supercharging stations. By the time I got to 80%, my rate of charge dropped to 146 miles of range per hour of charge. By the time I was closing in on 90%, my rate of charge was around 100 miles of range per hour of charge. Clearly, the best strategy for long trips is to keep the battery below 80% because recharging above that takes a long time. This works only if charging stations are very close to the route and reasonably close to each other.  Another trip to O.C. Different charge stall than before. Still works the same way. My strategy, when spending a weekend in Ocean City, is to top up the Tesla right before driving into O.C. That gives me enough electricity to get through the weekend without recharging. Then I recharge on the way home.2019 Model 3 charging at 250+ kW (1021 m/hr) and it‚Äôs also in easy walking range to many restaurants.  It‚Äôs in the parking lot of a Royal Farms also so there‚Äôs those snacks and restrooms if you just want something quick.There are six chargers here. At least two of them are defective. I spent an hour trying to charge at one, and managed to add about 100 miles of charge before it generated some kind of network error and turned itself off.  Another Tesla owner had a similar experience at the stall next to me. But he was smarter and tried several different stalls before discovering that 1A, the westernmost charger, provided a normal charging experience.  The chargers are at a Royal Farms convenience store, and if what you want can be purchased there, it's fine. Lots of nearby restaurants, but they are across a fast, dual lane highway and require a dangerous run across the road.Conveniently at Royal Farms. Also many nearby places on Route 50 to pick up a snack on the way to enjoy while charging.  Well lit with nearby police patrols.

I've sometimes had issues with one of the chargers being unresponsive or not working. But it's a convenient location. Until it's after 9pm. Electrify America says this is a 24 hr location but access is cut off once the outlet mall is closed.Google maps, as of 12/16/2022 has the charging stations incorrectly located at the mall.  it's basically under the I-270 south bound ramp.  there is a central reservation opening that has been blocked off, and the mapping makes it look like you have to go into the parking lot.  do not do this, the parking lot is a zoo.  just go all the way around the mall drive and come up on the chargers the long way around.  also, not sure why all the new developments in MD up to Frederick are being designed with roundabouts basically no one knows how to use them, people are either impatient or very confused, no one knows how to sign and the mall itself, a zoo in the parking lot.  long story short if you're not a native of the area, best to avoid the station unless you really need it.  I've submitted a change request from Google maps, not sure if it will get fixed - just take the long way around.  oh and the first charger I went to had a cord with a communication error.Beware that Google maps has the location slightly wrong. You need to enter the Premium Outlets and the chargers are located on the outer parking lot close to the Michael Kors store.

Half the stations are broken and it can take over 30 min to get support on the line only to find out that the station you are trying to use, and looks like it is in service doesn't actually work - but they won't take it off line to prevent people from wasting their time.

We used the slower charger, at 32kw, charged for 2 hours, what should have taken minutes. At 23 cents a minute, and wasting our time, it was a horrible experience.

Though they do power 100% of their electricity from Renewable Energy, via buyback programs with sustainable energy farms. Still pretty expensive‚Ä¶but with Electricity already being drastically cheaper than gas, I don‚Äôt mind contributing to a green cause if it means I get awesome parking upfront, more space & security around my car.

EV map was showing Most fast charging stations  located near by downtown and Round Rock.  Me and my husband from west central Texas(lil over 3hrs away from Austin),and we wasn't sure where to find a fast charging station for our 2020 Kia Niro EV.  Luckily, we found this spot but EV map wasn't showing a whole lot a details. Whether it has CHAdeMO, CCS.and J1772.  Soon as we were at this location,  OMG , I see the FAST charging station and nobody wasn't using at the time. There is  only 2 fast charging tower and 1 of tower wasn't available.  Luckily next to other charging tower was work.  We used CCS charger.  Before we put on charger, we only had a 39% power left on our car. We put on charger about less than 40 minutes later, it was 90% full.  This is just reminder,  with CCS charger battery wont charging a 100%. I do not know why they capped at 90% but, yeah 90% is  max capped. It wont let you charging any further. So if you want to charge your battery for 100%, you have to switch to CHAdeMO for rest of 10%.  0.21 cents per kw, yeah, it was little higher than where my husband went to last time. (Last time he went to Walmart EV charging station and their rate was 0.12 cents per kw. And this was only about 3 or 4 month ago). I guess because it located at right by airport  that maybe the reason why its pricey on this charging station.  Oh also,  at this location,  they have WHATABURGER, Subway, TEXACO gas station,  and few other convenient shop at same shopping center.  I just hope they have more than 2 CCS and CHAdeMO fast charging station.One station has painters tape on it saying it doesn't accept payment so we tried the other one.  It wouldn't initiate with the Chargepoint app so we tried with Apple pay.  That worked but it wanted me to acknowledge that I wasn't using a membership and the touch screen doesn't work well so I had to randomly press around on the screen until I luckily got it to register that I accepted the fact that I was just paying with a credit cardWhoever put this station in Rocks!  Next door to airport parking lots and a coffee shop.  Great for that little bit of power you need to get home.Great place to wait when you are picking up and you are right there at the terminals. Very nice and clean inside if you need food or drink. Can buy gas while waiting.  Its the best of both worlds.  Too bad other airports don't have a brain to do this.  Oh and you dont have to pay just to come and drop off or pick up. The days of DFW Airport are gone. It is totally worth the drive if you are even a little closer to that ridiculous DFW. No tolls to get here and no pay every time you have to drop off someone and go back to pick up. You can buy a meal for what you have to pay to get to and in DFW. Bergstrom International hands down an awesome airport. Im thrilled we are 24 minutes closer but I would go to Bergstrom if it was further wayCool little place to charge your electric cars, before a long trip after an airport ride, pick up a couple of snacks at the corner store, or the joining Whataburger.",4.2

The parking spots always have trash and spilled food or drinks. The charging is also very slow here no matter the stall.  Do better Tesla.This supercharger was a lifesaver after being parked at the airport for a week in cold weather (I think we arrived at the charger with 3%). Based on other reviews, I was a little worried about slow charging speeds but I got ~140kw the entire time, even with 3-4 other cars there.  We had a hitch mounted carrier and were able to back in and still reach the charging cable. There were two chargers that you could use even if you had a trailer attached. Also, the hotel attendant didn't even question us when we went inside looking for restrooms.  So I think overall a good spot. As always, more amenities like food/snacks would be better, but I think from a family perspective this one is pretty great. I could imagine even letting kids run around inside the hotel lobby on bad weather days.Tesla map says it's 250 kW but the charging speed is hardly 40kW at 110 mi/hr that's too slow.Six chargers in total, easy to find using Tesla GPS. Tesla employee was here fixing a supercharger while I charged. They maintain them well.Slow charging from 2A. Moved to 3B and got much better result.

I decided to chance it and come by, and thankfully I was able to snag one of the fast chargers. Fast chargers are pretty much non-existent in Rochester so I have nothing to compare it against. However, 30 minutes got me about 30% in charge.  4 stars because there were a couple that were out.I‚Äôve charged my 2022 Ioniq 5 five or six times here in the last month. No issues whatsoever. The 350kW chargers have worked perfectly every time. Plug in and go. Not sure what has been happening for the people who have left negative reviews but my experience here has been positive every time.  UPDATE: tried going here on 11/8/22 and 11/15/22. The station was out of service both times. It appears it is being repaired or upgraded. Regardless, as of 11/15/22, the station is NOT operational.  UPDATE 2: visited on 11/26/22 and the station is back online. 3 of the 4 charging stations have been upgraded to newer models. Charging station 4 is still one of the older models but it still works fine as it is the one I used.  UPDATE 3: visited on 12/19/22. All 3 of the newly installed charging stations were ‚Äúunavailable‚Äù. The older station still there was operational and in use.  It appears this location has become unreliable since they chose to upgrade the charging stations. Very disappointing.Recently upgraded to latest generation chargers. Hopefully reliability will improve as a result and our first charge here post-renovation was flawless.I live in the city of Buffalo and these chargers are down/unavailable more than they are available. Oftentimes, there's only one charger available for use making it especially difficult for people who visit this area and have no other alternatives. These chargers malfunction during colder months, y'all gotta work that out because the temps in Buffalo can get frigid. The availability of chargers should also be transparent via internet search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) and not only using your app. I've spoken to many nice out-of-town folks (some who don't speak fluent English -add more language selections on the stations) who go into panic mode when they can't charge their vehicle because chargers are limited. I always offer up mine because I am closer to home and never want to experience what that feels like. The demand for EV's doesn't align with the supply of charging stations and/or the amount of kWh sometimes promised per charge. There's too much stress and pressure on consumers and not enough action taken by Companies who should be making the transition from gas to an EV easier. The goal for creating a cleaner Earth is a bit one-sided. You have to supply better chargers if you really want to ""Electrify America"".Works good once you get it to connect.

I would not recommend this location if you're in a rush or driving along the I-15. This isn't the place where you want to stop, even though it has 250kw chargers.  I think this location is meant for shoppers of the outlet. There is a ticketing booth that will charge for parking (for non-Nevada residents, as of 2023). Tesla supercharger users can enter/leave without paying, but you'll have to request for the gate to be opened.  It's not scenic, it's not necessarily convenient unless you're a shopper, and there's that annoying bit about possibly paying for parking or waiting for an attendant to open the gate.  The chargers themselves work and the location seems great for locals/shoppers. There are plenty of food choices, restrooms, and things to do while you wait.  I just need to emphasize that this location is not recommended for travelers; rather, it is perfect for shopping that takes between 30mins - 1 hr.The people paying for, don't read the signs that state tesla owners don't pay... there are instructions to call via the intercom, and they open the exit, without payment. It's actually very fast, I've never been stuck waiting for the attendant to respond.It says 250kw max, but in reality you get around 50kw. Which pretty much forces you to go shopping at the outlets since it will take over an hour to charge it to full before heading back home.This is the worst charging station I have been to. We waited 1.5 hours to charge for 25 mins. Most of the stalls were taken up by cars done charging already and just leaving car unattended. I found one spot where the car wasn't even plugged in and security did end up giving it a citation.

This is the second time this year I've been to this location and charging stops for no reason. They really need to put up a sign stating what cars will charge best off which chargers at all EV charging stations.

Zero.This is the first one in a while where all the chargers worked. The nature of EV charging warrants being close to amenities. Unlike gas vehicles it's not a 5-minute process for us. A Walmart is one of the worst places to put an EV charging station because there's next to nothing around most of the time. Then on top of that it's a Walmart. Something that I personally strive to never go in. They stick the chargers way out in the back of the parking lot, not a bathroom in sight. At this location there's not even someplace within reasonable walking distance to grab a bite to eat while you're charging.This location has straight spaces.  I've seen 2 different configurations of EA Charging Stations: diagonal parking spaces with chargers in-between the spaces, and straight-in spaces with chargers mounted at the head of each space. Diagonal works better for EVs with side-mounted charging ports, and straight-in for EVs with front or back ports. All have very heavy and inflexible cords that tend to stress the EV charging port. Cords should be more flexible and several feet longer.  Difficult to reach charging port on the side of my Bolt and I saw one Taycan driver's solution was to take up 3 spaces to reach his side-mounted port.",2.8

This Sheetz, like most others, has fantastic staff, a clean layout, and toilets you can access 24/7 (unlike strip mall based charging stops). It's also large enough to have an eating area so if you want to chill for a little longer and enjoy your greasy messy Big Mozz sandwich or something you can do so without getting your car all dirty. :)  Traffic can be a little heavy at times, since this is a very good location for any kind of fueling up, but bonus points for putting the charging stalls near the drive-thru lane.

One trick though: if you have to stop charging and neither the app nor the touchscreen is working, tap your mobile pay again and the touchscreen will be activated.Nice and quiet location to charge. While never full, this station still has penalty fees for 3 hours or more. Rather than charging a fair and stable hourly charge, they increase the hourly fee by 600% beginning in the 3rd hour.

Columbus received a total of $50 million in the form of two grants, $40 million from USDOT and $10 million from Vulcan, Inc., a Paul Allen company. These dollars provide the seed funding for Smart Columbus, a region-wide Smart City initiative co-led by the City of Columbus and Columbus Partnership.  The City of Columbus, under the leadership of Mayor Andrew J.

Better coverage, more reliable equipment, better pricing, and better driver support, and exceptional service when you need to call and speak with a rep.  This particular charging station is in the sub surface, underground garage level.  If you enter the parking lot from a particular direction, you won't even be able to tell that there is an underground level.  Maps usually takes you to the right spot, only not the right level.  If you can see the sky above your car you're on the wrong level.

Soon as we were at this location,  OMG , I see the FAST charging station and nobody wasn't using at the time. There is  only 2 fast charging tower and 1 of tower wasn't available.  Luckily next to other charging tower was work.  We used CCS charger.  Before we put on charger, we only had a 39% power left on our car. We put on charger about less than 40 minutes later, it was 90% full.  This is just reminder,  with CCS charger battery wont charging a 100%. I do not know why they capped at 90% but, yeah 90% is  max capped. It wont let you charging any further. So if you want to charge your battery for 100%, you have to switch to CHAdeMO for rest of 10%.  0.21 cents per kw, yeah, it was little higher than where my husband went to last time. (Last time he went to Walmart EV charging station and their rate was 0.12 cents per kw. And this was only about 3 or 4 month ago). I guess because it located at right by airport  that maybe the reason why its pricey on this charging station.  Oh also,  at this location,  they have WHATABURGER, Subway, TEXACO gas station,  and few other convenient shop at same shopping center.  I just hope they have more than 2 CCS and CHAdeMO fast charging station.One station has painters tape on it saying it doesn't accept payment so we tried the other one.  It wouldn't initiate with the Chargepoint app so we tried with Apple pay.  That worked but it wanted me to acknowledge that I wasn't using a membership and the touch screen doesn't work well so I had to randomly press around on the screen until I luckily got it to register that I accepted the fact that I was just paying with a credit cardWhoever put this station in Rocks!  Next door to airport parking lots and a coffee shop.  Great for that little bit of power you need to get home.Great place to wait when you are picking up and you are right there at the terminals. Very nice and clean inside if you need food or drink. Can buy gas while waiting.  Its the best of both worlds.  Too bad other airports don't have a brain to do this.  Oh and you dont have to pay just to come and drop off or pick up. The days of DFW Airport are gone. It is totally worth the drive if you are even a little closer to that ridiculous DFW. No tolls to get here and no pay every time you have to drop off someone and go back to pick up. You can buy a meal for what you have to pay to get to and in DFW. Bergstrom International hands down an awesome airport. Im thrilled we are 24 minutes closer but I would go to Bergstrom if it was further wayCool little place to charge your electric cars, before a long trip after an airport ride, pick up a couple of snacks at the corner store, or the joining Whataburger.",4.2

Be aware that, not only does ChargePoint charges an additional $5.00 on your credit card on the first purchase (my bill was $22.75 (01:29:00 + 00:01:00 idle time to disconnect ;-(  ) CP made 2 charges; 1 for $10 00 + 1 for $20.00), but depending on the state, they can bill either by the kWh used. Or, by the minute (much more expensive).  Now that I'm aware of CP charging an additional $5.00, I decided to add $2.25, or so (out of $2.75 credit).  After all, why should they be allowed to keep more of my money than they already are?  But, when I pulled up to the first charging station, it took me several minutes to get to the point on the app to, Start Charging. :-(  Once I got it hooked up, and going, all was going OK. Yay!  But, after a few seconds, I noticed a, Not Charging, message. :-(  So, rather than fight that station again, I moved my car to the next one.  And, finally! Got this station working, and added, $2.29 (about 12 miles) to the my EV.  Now, to be honest, these public charging stations are great while traveling. However, depending on the state, regular gas vehicles can be cheaper to fill up.  But, for driving around town, and despite the long time needed to charge on a 110V outlet (12 hours gave me 45 miles. The cost? $0.84! Yes, only eightyfour cents!).  So, for gas vs home electric costs, EVs are a much better deal. Though, still cost prohibitive for many people (starting at around $38,000, and can exceed $250,000).  But, prices are dropping (just like the first Plasma 40"" set was $14,999.99). And, in a few years, EV prices are expected to be under $30K for the lower end models  My EV recommends leaving it plugged in.

Sometimes some chargers are down, but usually there are a couple of working chargers. The 2 negative points for this location are: that they don't have any 350kW dispensers, and that you can practically count on there being one dispenser out of service.  Each time I charged It took about 1 hour to charge my F150 Lightning (ext range) from about 28% to 85% state of charge.  But results will also vary among the make and model of EVs. The Lightning is decent on charging times, but not among the fastest-charging EVs.  All in all, this charging station is among the better of the ones I've used. The location is also fairly safe. It's well-lit, in a good area, close to many businesses including a 24-hour Wal-Mart, and is easy to reach just off the 101 freeway and on Camelback.  By the way, while there are various charging station locations all over we do need many more. It's a growing market still early-ish in development. Nonetheless, EV owners don't have to worry too much about running out of power these days.Works decently. More charging stalls wouldn't hurt. Level 2s would be nice as well.Convenient if your shopping at Walmart.  For coffee you have the BK and Dannys donut shop within walking distance.Super easy to use, very convenient.

Next closest one is exit 35 in Ozark or exit 78 in Lowel off I49 near Fayetteville.   Might as well grab some pizza at Casey's while you wait.No one else there, went into the gas station and used the bathroom, it was clean, and got a fountain drink, threw away thrash at trash can near the gas tanks, then laid back and chilled a bit and made it to Little Rock with plenty of battery to spare üíéüôåüåéüíõ250kW stalls and easy access to food and restrooms 24/7.

I didn‚Äôt have trip planned. I when there for the experience.Busy, not as fast as you would think when busy.  If there‚Äôs no one here when you come by, then yes you can get a great amount of power in a short amount of time - but it‚Äôs rare that there‚Äôs not much Tesla‚Äôs here.  You can go into the Rite Aid and mess around/buy something you don‚Äôt need while you charge but, like some kind of Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat situation, you only realize how slow the charger is when you get out of the car.  Overall, it‚Äôs good, but also not as quick or convenient as you‚Äôd think.Too much afternoon traffic getting to this charger - further from the highway and charger is busier than most. Several busy and slow intersections. Would recommend finding another.Awesome speed!!! I would give another star if the station was on a level surface and perhaps covered. Woo Hoo! True Supercharging! (unlike many others) I just needed enough to get 40 miles to home. But I was well under 20% charge so I added about 100 miles in about 5 minutes for $10.08. At one point the car said it was charging at over 1200 miles per hour. Would have been about 23 minutes to 80% I think. Quick turnover on charging spots. While some amenities are available there isn't much need for them when I can get the charge I need so quickly. Very happy to stop at this station.I have been here 3 times out of which 2 were after sunset. There were always homeless people hanging around the super charger area. Also both times there were cop cars patrolling the area. This is one of the great superchargers in terms of the charging speed, unfortunately not at a great location. I would rather go to the Auburn mall for charging than here.",3.2

Wendy's, Caribou coffee/Einstein bagels, DQ/orange Julius, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell inside and Arby's across the street.One of the first charging stations I've been to that has a trash can next to the chargers. There are also chargepoint chargers available. Close to the truck stop and truck museum with plenty to doFairly new location for Tesla, located within the Iowa 80 truckstop (Claims to be the largest truckstop in the world). Prices slightly higher per KW compared to other charging stations we utilized on our trip from Denver to DavenportVery nice place to stop by for charging - it has total of 8 Tesla connectors with max 250KWH power delivery (V3 super charger) for charging very quickly. It has multiple options for food like Pizza hut, Iowa 80 Kitchen, Dairy queen, Wendy's and for coffee lovers, there is a caribou coffee shop . Also the charging station is right next to the I80 truck museum- really worth visiting who likes or interested in knowing about the trucks. This place also has the charge point company connectors available for non Tesla electric vehicles.Great supercharger stop. Plenty of room to back into the chargers. Lots to do in the truck stop with a food court and shopping available.",4.8

Second of all, I'm glad the charging station is here because I needed a top-off. I'm not sure what the prices are for the 7kWh charger, but the prices for the 64kWh are expensive. I'm not sure whether the cost is determined by the power consumed, or by the time spent on the charger, but I was charged $23.75 for 5.3 kWh of juice, or about 30%/30 miles of range for my Leaf, and was parked for approx. 90 minutes. By comparison, I was charged $1.73 for 6.4 kWh the other day while using a charging station at my office. Next time I visit, I'll try the 7kWh charger and see if the prices are as extreme. $23.75 for 5.3 kWh is highway robbery and had I known the price up front I would not have used it.Very nice charging station!",3.5

There have been a few times when I had to wait, but not very long. With the other Folsom Supercharger offering more options for food and shopping, this one tends to be forgotten.The Supercharger delivers as expected, though it could have been better placed.  To reach the chargers, take the first left-turn into the parking lot from Iron Point Road and then turn right again to enter the parking lot. The four parking spaces are along edge of the lot near Iron Point Road, but roughly in the middle of the lot between the the first and second parking lot entrances.  The location could be better. There is no overhead cover against rain and sun, and nothing above eye-level to indicate where in the parking lot the chargers are located. There's no sidewalk nearby and the short charging cables mean you have to park nose-in and cannot pull through when leaving. The rightmost two parking spots are the most convenient - they back onto an aisle between rows of cars, while the two spots on the left are across from a curb and row of cars, which gives you less space to back out.  The Folsom Premium Outlets are convenient if you are traveling Highway 50, less so if you need to get back onto I-80. The outlet mall is extremely focused on clothing, so options for spending time there while charging during a road trip are limited. Most of the dining options are fast food and most are across Iron Point Road.I visit here a few times a month to charge up. There a few convenience shops and fast food chains in walking distance.

Which is becoming more often.Fastest EV chargers in the Omaha metro area by a long shot, but of course your car must support the fast speeds to take full advantage; mine tops out at around 4 mi/min. The area is conveniently located near many areas to shop and eat. I do wish it was a little more centrally located, or that another Wal-Mart closer to the interior of Omaha would install these.I connected to a chademo rapid charger at 4:08 yesterday, the charger immediately malfunctioned (charger error 34) and locked itself to my car.  After an hour on the phone with tech support they agree to dispatch a tech, I am asked to wait at my vehicle (this is 5:30) At 6:30 they call back and say they have been unable to find a tech but are still looking, at 7:30 they call and say a tech will arrive in 2 and a half hours.  At 9:30 they call and say it will be at least another hour.  Keep in mind it's January in Nebraksa and now rolling into evening.  What turned into a stop for a quick 20 minute charge has now become a 6 hour ordeal, and I'm not in the middle of nowhere, I'm in Omaha Nebraska, the largest metro area for several hundred miles.  Each time I spoke to tech support it was clear they had no idea what was happening, or didn't want to tell me, lots of I can't disclose that information.  It became clear the person I had been speaking to all night did not actually dispatch the tech and was not actually communicating with the tech, she was desperately trying to help but also seemed to solidly have her hands tied behind some really truly awful costumer service policies.  Tech finally arrived just after 10:30, at this point I had been stuck for nearly 6 and a half hours, I didn't get home until just after midnight.  So, know, this is a risk you take when you plug into one of these devices, are you prepared to be stuck for 7 plus hours to get that quick charge?Station 3 has card issues and station for only charges to 3 kWh before malfunction.

Second of all, I'm glad the charging station is here because I needed a top-off. I'm not sure what the prices are for the 7kWh charger, but the prices for the 64kWh are expensive. I'm not sure whether the cost is determined by the power consumed, or by the time spent on the charger, but I was charged $23.75 for 5.3 kWh of juice, or about 30%/30 miles of range for my Leaf, and was parked for approx. 90 minutes. By comparison, I was charged $1.73 for 6.4 kWh the other day while using a charging station at my office. Next time I visit, I'll try the 7kWh charger and see if the prices are as extreme. $23.75 for 5.3 kWh is highway robbery and had I known the price up front I would not have used it.Very nice charging station!",3.5

The app PlugShare has been a lifesaver for finding alternatives and is very user friendly. The chargepoint charger by tofurkey hq is a much better option.  The phone call required to start up Webasto stations as a non-member tends to take a full 10 minutes every time - other brands‚Äô stations (blink, chargepoint, Volta) do not require a call to start, so having to call and wait on hold seems like a pretty unnecessary hassle.  Webasto are also the only brand of chargers that has been unreliable for me - today, this charger did not work, and I had one instance elsewhere where the charger inexplicably timed out. In both cases, calling customer service to troubleshoot was pretty frustrating - today, the rep insisted the problem was my car and not the station, even though 2 other brands of stations had worked for me in the past day. Immediately after our call I drove to a chargepoint station which worked successfully, so I followed up and informed Webasto that the problem was indeed their charger, not my car.  I am hoping Webasto addresses this issue - this location is so convenient and I‚Äôd love to charge here.

All 6/6 low power plugs are not functional. There is no way to know unless you check the website.  So, I moved to 50kw charge port, it charges you 0.3$/min, too expensive, just for 4% of my model 3 LR, (4kw use) it costed me 1.95$ which is not acceptable as it charges based on time not on kw consumed, (coz, after 80% charging speed will be slow on tesla) so you'd be paying more likely 2x of super charging cost. The speed is not even 1/2x of supercharger but costs you much more.  FYI, I have used volta free charging in lots of places, you just go there and plug it in and that's it.

Most EA locations utilize what I've come to think of as ""plug and pray"" technology because that's what EA customers find themselves doing. Praying that the charger is going to actually work.  Thankfully, I've visited this location on multiple road trips up into the Lassen National Forrest. I found that the chargers worked every time which is truly miraculous as any frequent EA customer knows. These appear to be updated charging units and I suspect this explains my good fortune.  Near by food and beverage amenities are abundant. Stoble's coffee is my fav. Lots of options within reasonable walking distance in a safe, small town, downtown district area.  My only complaint is that when this area is busy and the lot is full of ICE cars and EVs, EV drivers who must back into these angled stalls will have some difficulty (i.e. backing in without touching the Rivian in the stall to the right; or the Lucid Air in the stall to the left; or without ramming into bubba's truck nuts equipped tow hitch on the F-250 parked in the stall directly on the other side of the one way lane).  I wish EA wouldn't just cram these chargers into random, small sized parking lots with limited approach angles and limited maneuvering space. For real, when full, it is challenging to back in. Even worse, the cords are too short to reach the back of my teeny tiny Polestar 2 when pulling in nose first! If EA could at least give us longer cords at this location the issue I just described would be avoidable.New to charging an EV and this is a good location and seems safe in a bank parking lot.

It is about a 10 to 15 minute drive from the BQE highway exit depending on traffic so you have to go a bit out of your way to get to the location. As of this review, all 25 chargers work with ccs1, 23 work with tesla, and 2 work with chademo.  You could pay with credit card, or tap with the revel app if you put in payment info within the app. Just be aware that that I was told by a Revel tesla taxi driver that sometimes the payment might not work at a station from time to time. This happened to me on my first visit. I could not get my payment to work. The driver suggested I try a different stall and that solved the problem. So if you have trouble paying to get the chargers started, try try again.  As of this review, the price of the charge is priced at 39 cents a kwh plus tax. Some of the chargers says 75 kwh max but my tesla only got just below 50 max and at times dip to the high 30s. I read that is common. Not sure if that is limited to tesla or most evs here.  I am really glad this place exists. Nyc really need more places like this to make evs work. Hope this survives and that they would expand to other locations in NYC.  I had to take out a star though because it would be nice to have a restroom for those long charge times if needed.I have been to this charger four times over the past two weeks. The chargers are supposed to push 75kw. They have never reported charging above 44kw. My Tesla Model Y has never reported charging above 36kw despite the meter saying it was charging at 44kw. There are lots of spaces but there are zero amenities (no bathroom, no food, sketchy bodega two blocks away). I am really excited for this location to improve (we need this!!!) but as of July 20 it‚Äôs barely operating. Don‚Äôt give up Revel, we need you!I read all of the bad reviews at this station and wanted to give it a try myself with the new Tesla brand CCS adapter because I read that Tesla‚Äôs could only get 50KW with the Tesla adapter that the charging station has.  I‚Äôm pleased to find out that with the CCS adapter I got 71KW at its peak and 56KW at its low point. It was a really cold day so it took my battery sometime to heat up but I would assume on a nicer day I could hit 70KW faster.  Just be aware that this station puts a pre charge of $30 on your credit statement and it adjusts to what you will actually be charged.Note, per the specs limit of the ""Tesla CHAdeMO Adapter"" that Revel uses to charge Teslas as this site, 50 kW is the fastest possible speed you'll see, but other brands should see faster speeds using the CCS connector.  This is an inclusive facility with the promise for much easier ownership of any EV brand that‚Äôs capable of DC fast charging, which is nearly every EV sold today. It should really help make EV ownership much more of a possibility for local residents of Brooklyn, without having to pay to get into a garage just to charge.  There were some payment processing issues experienced by several Teslas on the evening of July 7 2021, the very first day Revel launched their payment processing system at this site. Contactless payment (Apple Pay with non-Amex card such as Visa or Apple Card) seemed to work better than magnetic card swipes or chip reading. I have compiled a list of the variety of issues we saw, and reported them to Revel on July 8th 2021. Revel has stated that at least some of the known issues have been resolved.Brand new 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-e (extended battery) was showing 71.4kW+ when charging there for the first time, I wouldn't be surprised if it reached 75KW after it conditioned when I wasn't looking. It sure beat SLO Chargers, I mean FLO Chargers.",3.8

The only time these chargers work efficiently is after a call to electrify or you are willing to drive to Greene Acre Mall super fast chargers. Evolve & Electrify get it together!!!There are about 10 Electrify America charging stations here. Each station has a CCS and CHAdeMO connector. You plug in the connector first, and then follow the onscreen instructions to pay with a credit card. At the time of writing this on a Sunday at 5pm it was $0.35/kWh. Not sure if it varies by time or not. That's cheaper than the Tesla Supercharger nearby so if you are waiting already anyways at this cell phone lot, it might be better to charge here (if you have the CCS adapter that is).  The credit card reader has a tap-and-pay option but it always failed for me on different credit cards without giving a reason. Only when you slide in the credit card with the chip did the payment go through. I also had trouble with some stations (""charging error"") so I had to repark the car to try a different one.  After payment is authorized, charging starts and you have the option to leave a phone number for charging updates or download the app. I was able to get a throughput of 44kW but to be fair I also had a high state of charge. Once charging is complete or you stop charging, the card is then charged.  Parking is free as it's inside the cell phone parking lot. There are restrooms nearby and sometimes a food truck is here too.Easy to use. You have option to pay with credit card not like other stations that require a specific card or app this one is pretty straightforward you just plug in charge and pay just like at a regular gas station. The parking is free and from my experience theirs always available charging ports.No crowded. Charging always available. No waiting.

Much better experience than what I had in Raleigh.The stalls are new, the charge rate is fast, however it should not cost nearly 8 times as much as charging at home. Taking road trips and charging at this price is going to make electric cars cost MORE than gas. The average commercial price of a kilowatt is $0.09/KwH in warsaw, so why is it most than 4 times as much? $25 to go from 15 to 80% is outrageous when it costs me $3.70 at home, or FREE at other chargers.

Or, by the minute (much more expensive).  Now that I'm aware of CP charging an additional $5.00, I decided to add $2.25, or so (out of $2.75 credit).

Got this station working, and added, $2.29 (about 12 miles) to the my EV.  Now, to be honest, these public charging stations are great while traveling. However, depending on the state, regular gas vehicles can be cheaper to fill up.  But, for driving around town, and despite the long time needed to charge on a 110V outlet (12 hours gave me 45 miles. The cost? $0.84! Yes, only eightyfour cents!).  So, for gas vs home electric costs, EVs are a much better deal. Though, still cost prohibitive for many people (starting at around $38,000, and can exceed $250,000).  But, prices are dropping (just like the first Plasma 40"" set was $14,999.99).

You won't be competing for spots or waiting for long, you just pull in, plug in, and shop at Stuckey's for a bit. It's also got the best view of any Supercharger I stopped at off I-40, which makes it a fabulous day-time stop.  At night, Stuckey's is all there is so it gets lonely fast. The store closes after 9 PM, so you lose access to the toilets and the Dairy Queen inside (if it's late and you can make it to Hickory or Asheville, I suggest you go there).  Speaking of toilets, that's my only real CON about this place. The toilets were terrible the last time I stopped here. Even if they were to be freshly serviced, the bathroom itself feels like it'll never be that be clean (or dry). On the other hand, it looks like there are showers available if you ask. I've definitely stopped at more welcoming Stuckey's though.  PROs? Cheap candy, and Stealth Bombers to keep you occupied (if you're not driving).The supercharger is great.

The gas station, stores and restaurants are still under construction. (Oct 1, 2022) Lots of space and there was a cop on duty. Not sure what that was for but I guess it stops people from vandalizing the chargers. Once the gas station and stores are open, I will update it to 5 stars.  I see several reviews where the say they charged at 250 KW, I was only getting 56 KW both time (AM and PM).As others have stated at the time of this post the Exxon is still under construction. Which is disappointing because I‚Äôll have to find another bathroom. Giving it 5 stars anyway because it‚Äôs 250kW and it‚Äôs at a (future) gas station.  Not a fan of chargers at venues like the one in Tulsa Oklahoma. Yeah it had a bathroom but it was far away from the chargers in the casino.  Having these chargers at convenience stores makes so much more sense.This site was s still under construction so in spite of what is stated on Tesla‚Äôs site, there is not yet a restroom or beverages. There IS, however, the porta potty being used by construction workers so that‚Äôs good. Love the fast chargers. 6/24/2022Used 5/12/2022 about 5:30pm.  3 of 8 chargers in use when we arrived. Charged our M3 long range from 20% to 80% in only 19 minutes. Initial charge rate was 250kwh and an amazing 1000 miles / hour.  As others have said, there are no amenites here, just a convenience mart and gas station under construction.  Bathrooms are across the interstate on the other side of the exit where there is another (Valero) gas station and convience store.  4 stars due to lack of amenities at the moment, but it will be  5 star place once the convenience store opens.Currently (as of Aug 6th) showing ""reduced Service"" on Tesla in car navigation. Due to adjacent construction, 3 of the stalls are blocked. However, the remaining stalls are functioning perfectly. So, just know that it is possible that, if it shows ""3 stalls available"" you might have a wait if the 5 actually available stalls are full. But this is not typically a very busy Supercharger.  The ""Texas Best BBQ"" that is listed as an amenity is under construction and not yet open, but there is an ""Eco-Loo"" restroom on site and there is a Valero nearby (within site) for refreshments in until the BBQ place opens.",3.8

Not clear) Since it‚Äôs not open, No restrooms. Also has advertised a dog park.  All we saw were some abandoned steel bowls behind a Tesla charger, not enclosedl. Plus is 8 Tesla chargers are up and running. The closest thing is a Citgo across the street which the owner isn‚Äôt so keen on having a bunch of non customers using their restroom. There is Love‚Äôs truck stop on the other side of the overpass (Ie not walkable) that has a restroom, McDonalds, Subway and a convenience store. Would not recommend unless this is a quick charge and you don‚Äôt need the restroom or food. Otherwise would either plan to go to Florence to charge if you are on 95. Or plan to make two stops and additional time.It doesn't get more Mom-n-Pop-Shop than this. This oversized convenience store and gas station (Stuckey's) now has 250kW (fast) superchargers! With a Dairy Queen, clean bathrooms, tons of cheap candy and more knickknacks than you can shake a stick at, it's likely that your Tesla will be done snacking before you're done having a look around. If there's a downside, it's how dark and quiet the lot gets late at night. If there's an upside, you get to park your Tesla under the price of gas and enjoy your way cheaper fill-up. :D  The store does close at some point, like other reviewers have said. However, Google says  that's at 7:30 and I was still taking pictures there at 8:50 PM, so there may be seasonal variance.  If you're locked out and need to use a restroom, I suggest driving across the overpass and drop into the Love's Travel Stop.  Past that, this place is a goldmine if you like retro candy, astronaut ice cream diecast cars and cheap souvenirs. It's not often you get the country store feel with your supercharging, so I think this is worth the stop!  (P.S. Also, this is South Carolina, so don't be surprised to see a ton of pro-gun humor and college team signs available for sale/as decor. That may make an uncomfortable environment for some. As someone whose politics generally doesn't align with the signage, I would encourage others to also judge the stop by the people inside. I found the night staff to be friendly and the other customers politely disinterested what I thought about.)8 chargers just off I-95 at a Texaco station with a Stuckey's convenience store that houses a Dairy Queen. Bathroom was a bit gross but, hey, at least it was working! Depending on how you feel about guns and machismo, you will either feel right at home here or anxious to leave.If you are traveling with dogs this place is awesome. They have bathrooms for humans, dog park for your fury friends and a convenience store to fill up. Love this stop!Looked clean and was nice quick stop for a charge and some snacks during the day.

Swiping quickly can cause the transaction to fail.  ALSO, if you own a Tesla (like my Model 3) you need an adapter sold by Tesla to use the DC fast chargers at this location.  There are 4 CHAdeMO/CCS fast chargers and 2 J1772 chargers here. Charging is limited to two-hour session but you don't need to pay to park here as long as you're charging. The location is great, right next to the farmers market and downtown Milwaukie. Pay with credit card or use a Greenslots account to initiate charge (the stickers on the chargers are wrong, don't use the chargeway app).Nice spot to spend a few minutes charging. Nice places to visit in walking distance. Go skip stones across the street at the park or pop in to Things from another world comics shop. Get a selfie in front of Dark Horse comics HQ. The charging station got four stars because one of the screens was not working. Other than that safe and clean place to charge with trash cans and restrooms near by.Weird, we tried to use the charger for our E-Golf but neither the ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù or the ‚ÄúGreen‚Äù fit.  The E-Golf uses the same charger type as a Leaf and a ThinkCity.  The PGE charger has a rubber bar shaped thing under the plug in part that makes it impossible to plug in.  No wonder no one was using the chargers.Chargers are mislabeled in the app but all of them put out 50 kilowatts",3.8

The station's location is just perfect, as it's conveniently situated near the freeway, ensuring a quick and hassle-free pit stop for travelers.  Hotel Mission Del Oro itself is an exquisite property, offering top-notch amenities for those looking to unwind while their vehicle gets charged. The hotel's welcoming ambiance and well-appointed rooms provide a comfortable stay for guests. And if you're an AT&T user, you'll be pleased to know that the cell phone service is excellent in this area, making it easy to stay connected with friends, family, or work.  One of the highlights of this Supercharging station is its proximity to popular walkable dining options. My personal favorite has to be In-N-Out, which is just a short walk away. This iconic fast-food chain never disappoints with its mouthwatering burgers and shakes, making it an ideal choice to grab a quick bite while your Tesla charges. There are several other eateries in the vicinity, catering to a variety of tastes and preferences.  Adding to the convenience, the charging station is equipped with multiple Superchargers, ensuring availability and minimal wait times. The charging process itself is swift, allowing you to get back on the road in no time.  In conclusion, the Tesla Supercharging station at Hotel Mission Del Oro is an excellent pitstop for Tesla owners. Its strategic location, coupled with the hotel's amenities, superb AT&T cell phone service, and various dining options nearby, make it a must-visit for anyone traveling through the area.Lots of stalls and looks like more new ones soon.

I called the number on the charger and they stated it remotely, guiding me through the steps to get it working.

After I was done and put the handle back in the charger, it wouldn't recognize that it was disconnected. I called customer service again.

So an extra hour wasted. Since the other reviewer mentioned that EVgo said they would send someone to fix it, I assumed that in 5 months it got fixed, especially since a lot of people visit the outlet mall. Well I was wrong. First and last time using EVgo.The Level 3's CCS charger was broken when I needed it on 12/19. It refused to make a handshake because the data cable (which is in the top part of the charger) was warped. The first hint was the fact that when I got there the CCS combo charger was on the floor and wouldn't even stay in place in its cradle on the charger.  Anyways, I reported it to the EVGo support and asked for help; but I don't expect it to be fixed any time soon. The newer ChargePoint Level 3's have a better design that seems more durable. Hopefully EVGo has something like this some time soon.  Thankfully, there's a level 2 right there, which saved this from being a 1-star review and me from being stranded. However, I did have to pay $60 for an Uber to get my passengers home since I'd had wait two hours for a charge instead of 10 minutes.

The Tesla destination chargers were replaced with JuiceBar chargers that use AmpUp to charge you. They have J1772 plugs and charge at 10kW. The current rate is $3/hour plus taxes, fees, and idle fees ($5/hour starting 30 minutes after charging finishes). Max allowed charging time is 4 hours. Then you have to go unplug and plug back in to start a new session. The NEMA 14-50 and NEMA 5-20 (120v) outlets are still there if you have your UMC on you. The two times I used the 14-50 outlets, I had to turn on the circuit breakers in the breaker panel not too far away. There are three charger plugs and three outlets of each that reach four parking spaces, although a couple of spots were usually ICE‚Äôd.

Cons: one of the two 350kw chargers was out of service (both 100kw chargers were working and free though), the EVgo interface is not the most intuitive but it's easy enough once you get signed up and have the card, cost is a little high.

I often pay zero, but this is extremely high. I didn't check the cost of the Level-2 as I was very low and didn't want to even entertain waiting here for a few hours. Please revise pricing per kWh and I'll gladly come back as well as update this review. I wound up charging at an Electrify America at the speed of around 50kW (still slow for level-3) at a very high 43¬¢ per kWh with no subscription.Great fast new chargers but ONLY for Jaguar employees.Great EV Charging, fast, it's in the jaguar range Rover parking lot, lots of chargers, plus slow chargers as well.

In every  situation they have to reboot the machine and the entire call winds up adding 15 to 20 minutes on top of my 30 minute charge time.

Terrible customer experience.  45 minutes to get a charge plus just the nonsense of standing out in the heat to call their customer service line every time.

Literally you take a right of the exit and it is the first thing on the left. It‚Äôs in the Smithfield Chicken and Biscuit Parking lot. Has picnic tables and 12 charging spaces.It looks like Tesla and Smithfield‚Äôs has some type of partnership because I‚Äôm seeing a lot of stations behind Smithfield‚Äôs parking lots. We stopped here and it was great. It was late and I was the only car there. All the stations worked, and with a max of 250kwh it was charging over 925mph. I went to the bathroom, got a drink and by the time I got back it was charged past what I needed to get home. Much better experience than what I had in Raleigh.The stalls are new, the charge rate is fast, however it should not cost nearly 8 times as much as charging at home. Taking road trips and charging at this price is going to make electric cars cost MORE than gas. The average commercial price of a kilowatt is $0.09/KwH in warsaw, so why is it most than 4 times as much? $25 to go from 15 to 80% is outrageous when it costs me $3.70 at home, or FREE at other chargers. At the very least put off peak rates and stop gouging people.In the parking lot of smithfield BBQ chicken.  Close to cookout, McDonald's, Wendy's and waffle houseThis charger is excellent in terms of speed. There are 12 stalls and this is a 2021 V3 charger that maxed out to 250kW. Car charged at 1000 mi/hr! This location is good, not the best place to place it at. There is a Smithfield's and a Citgo. If you walk a little bit you can go to the McDonald's, Starbucks, and some other gas stations. Problem is, this charger is incredibly fast - so you won't be here for a long time.

The cost was 226.00!!!!  No other options in site so .75 cents per minute AND THEN they doubled the cost to 1.50 per minute after 60 minutes (only at 25% and useless at that point.)  how can ChargePoint allow this ?  Is this a record for a single charge ?  This was our first trip in an all electric vehicle and it was just stomach churning.  We will NOT be taking the Bolt on our next trip anywhere now.  TESLA has a major leg up with their network  in charging.  If we are going to suffer with price gauging then at least get the ‚Äúfast charging‚Äù stations to deliver an 80% charge in 45-60 minutes.  226.00 bill for a single charge ruined our experience.

You can walk to other amenities but the area is designed for fast moving cars and none of the amenities were all that interesting... just something to do while you charge. A proper coffee shop nearby and a cleaner parking lot would be nice.  Chargers are new in 2022. Someone didn't think through the location of the charger holster and the bollard, as the bollard partially blocks access to the holster.Pros: Fast charge on the 350kw, easy access off I5, not busy on a Friday evening, walking distance to Walmart, Home Depot, fast food, and some other shops, clean and well lit parking lot. Cons: one of the two 350kw chargers was out of service (both 100kw chargers were working and free though), the EVgo interface is not the most intuitive but it's easy enough once you get signed up and have the card, cost is a little high.  Overall, this was a good place to stop and charge.4 EVgo chargers (2x100kWH and 2x350kWH) present and working as of 02/02/2023. Each charger is technically capable of simultaneously charging two vehicles but in reality it‚Äôs not possible to do that here because there are only 4 parking spots.  Also 8 new Tesla chargers were just installed on the opposite side of the same parking lot.

Plus the batteries from EV's are hard to dispose of and harm the environment. EV's actually do more harm than good.

I don't have the right adapter for the fast charger which was $5. to connect. There are no chargers up and down 35 from the cities nor from here to WI along HWY 8.Stopped here on the way to and from northern Wisconsin. Both times the charger was in use when we arrived. Had to wait approximately 30 minutes for the fast charger. Used one of the 2nd level chargers while we waited for the fast charger to free up. There aren't a lot of other fast charging options nearby at the time of writing this (July 2021) so it's a popular spot. There is a pretty butterfly garden to look at, and there is a city park about a block away as well as a Casey's gas station within walking distance.We stopped here on July 3rd to add 15-20 minutes worth of charge time from the level 3 CCS charger to our 2020 Kona Ev ultimate so we could make it to Hayward, WI and then ultimately back to this charger to top off on our way home on July 4th. Likely due to the holiday weekend and sunny weather, we did encounter a shiny new fully electric Mustang charging when we arrived. There are ample level 2 J-1772 connectors here if you find the level 3 charger occupied. The level 2 chargers showed anywhere from 7.5 - 11KW in which was nice to add even a few miles to our battery while we waited for the Level 3 to open up. The mustang driver noticed we must've been waiting for the L3 charger and since they were just topping off while they had some time they cleared out and let us charge. Station worked great to quickly add some miles before we ventured to a friend's cabin in Hayward which is around 120 miles away.  We stopped again just to get enough miles to drop our friend off at home in Uptown Minneapolis and then make it home to our house in New Hope. Again, there was a wait for the Level 3 charger but we were able to add some miles on the Level 2 while we waited. The level 3 ultimately worked great again once it was available.  Bonus: there are 3 Pok√©mon Go Pokestops in spinning distance of the chargers plus a beautiful field of flowers and tall grass planted for butterflies and pollinators. There's also a bike/walking trail nearby and a handful of local stores and a Casey's general store within a few blocks so you don't necessarily need to sit and wait to charge if you want to go for a short walk.This location Have Tesla supercharger, otherwise we would have stranded.

The off-peak times used to be up to 11:00. A.m.Importantly, this place has both 150KWH and 250KWH charger (12 each). It was nice trip to the charger. I was expecting delays or slow due to the busy nature of the area but I still got one solo on 150K charger. For my model 3, from 12% to 8% in less than 30 minutes, no complains here. Target and Starbucks on two minutes walk, tempting but I resisted. Well lit and clean,  Overall a good experience. Noisy, I must say but that is because I-440 is just right behind the fence. Fortunately or Unfortunately, this is the only one in Raleigh City limits.There are 12 150kw superchargers and several 250kw superchargers, plus other EV chargers.  Love that the superchargers are parallel to your car when parking (versus perpendicular). Watch for the other people driving very fast on this road.This is a big Supercharger in a busy area but we were able to get 254kW even with 12 of the available stalls taken.",4.8

I prefer this supercharger than the ones at Livonia even though it's farther to me than the Livonia station.Situated near Meijer, the Tesla Supercharger boasts a favorable location that offers convenience to Tesla owners. While it may not have a vast number of charging slots, the available ones are sufficient for most charging needs. Despite the limited slots, it remains a satisfactory choice for Tesla drivers seeking a reliable charging solution. The proximity to Meijer also adds an extra advantage, allowing visitors to access amenities and services while their vehicles are being charged. Overall, it presents a decent location for Tesla charging, striking a balance between convenience and availability.No issues charging and was able to get a $0.20 TOU rate on Saturday morningFast, lots of chargers that don‚Äôt share power unlike older ones where they charge slower the more crowded it gets.
