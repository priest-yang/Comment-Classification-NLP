I would not recommend this location if you're in a rush or driving along the I-15. This isn't the place where you want to stop, even though it has 250kw chargers.

I think this location is meant for shoppers of the outlet. There is a ticketing booth that will charge for parking (for non-Nevada residents, as of 2023). Tesla supercharger users can enter/leave without paying, but you'll have to request for the gate to be opened.

It's not scenic, it's not necessarily convenient unless you're a shopper, and there's that annoying bit about possibly paying for parking or waiting for an attendant to open the gate.

The chargers themselves work and the location seems great for locals/shoppers. There are plenty of food choices, restrooms, and things to do while you wait.

4244,1968,"Didn't work for my Chevy Spark EV. I had planned a route to Salem for my nephew's 2nd birthday. I was excited because this was a new charger and was just the right distance to make it only 3 charging stops, instead of 4. I planned it out the night before, charged at my first stop just fine, got here with 6 miles left of range and tried to charge but it wouldn't connect with my car. Tried the other station and the same thing. Called the help number on the printed out piece of paper taped to the charger and he tried resetting the machine. The guy on the other end was nice and helpful, but ultimately we couldn't get it to connect and decided something was incompatible with the the software or hardware between the Spark EV and the charger. Thankfully I brought my level 1 charger and could slowly leech off the outlet at the park shelter nearby. I was able to get enough to get me to the next closest charger.

What was supposed to be a 20 min stop ended up being over 2 hours. We were going to be too late for the party so my family and I just decided to go back home. I have to now check with my credit card because trying to get it to charge put so many $30 holds on it that my credit card stopped working.

The charger in general is okay. The location is good, but I can't see how this is the future for everyone. You have to be quiet strong to manage the thick heavy charging cable. It's much more difficult to plug it in than to use a gas pump or even other fast chargers I've used. I couldn't imagine some of my older relatives having the wrist strength to operate it. And then what? There's no one to help you. It's also not covered, so bring an umbrella if it's raining. I was super excited to use this new charger, because it's been sometimes difficult for someone with a low-range, fast charging EV to get down to Portland and Salem in a reasonable time, but I guess my 7-year old car is too old?

Like most Tesla stations in a mall, they are a little bit of a walking distance from the mall itself but then close chargers in some malls like Volta chargers (usually in the front spaces of the mall) are taken up by non EV vehicles or taken up by EV vehicles that don‚Äôt leave the spot for hours.  They are several eateries that can be walked to like Menlo Park pizza and McDonald‚Äôs.  You can eat inside Menlo Park when open.  You can walk a little further to the Menlo Park Diner.  If you dare cross the big 3 lane/2 lane (5 lanes in either direction) street you can get to a Panera‚Äôs, sonic, and White Castle as well as a Margarita‚Äôs Mexican Restaurant.  Seasons 24 is also close by as well.  There is a 7-11 nearly as well.

I‚Äôm not sure if the sonic will return to 24 hour service again post COVID.

If people complain that the charging stations are too far from the mall.  No one is enforcing if a gas car parks in an EV charge spot‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs why the charging spot for Tesla and EVGo are isolated from the mall.  No one else is going to want to park there.  If you need an example, go to nearby Woodbridge mall and see if you can ever get into the Volta charging stations in front of the Macy‚Äôs.  Or even if an EV car is parked in those spaces.

6633,3092,"8x v3 (250kW / ""Superfast) Superchargers and Sheetz's tasty MTO food. It's a match made in heaven in an excellent location off of I-95!  Definitely the stop for night time travel too!

The great thing about the fast v3 stalls is that by the time you use the (usually) clean toilets, place an order for hot food and then receive it, your Tesla is done with its snack and is good for the next leg of your trip. This Sheetz, like most others, has fantastic staff, a clean layout, and toilets you can access 24/7 (unlike strip mall based charging stops). It's also large enough to have an eating area so if you want to chill for a little longer and enjoy your greasy messy Big Mozz sandwich or something you can do so without getting your car all dirty. :)

Traffic can be a little heavy at times, since this is a very good location for any kind of fueling up, but bonus points for putting the charging stalls near the drive-thru lane. Most of the non-tesla traffic on this side of the building is in the separate drive way to place the order which makes pulling into a spot a little easier. This partnership with Sheetz just gets better and smarter all the time!

7676,3580,"This charging station is the last place I fill up going over the mountain from Portland to Bend. There is one Chademo connector and one J1772 connector here. The rest of the plugs are CCS. I've only charged with the CCS at this location. There is no reason to charge with the J1772 plug here unless the Volta station nearby is full or you plan on charging longer than 2 hours. The CCS cables here aren't very long, so if your charging port is in the rear of your vehicle I would suggest backing into the charging stall. The cables here are also exceptionally bulky and heavy because they are liquid cooled. The liquid cooling is needed to keep the cables from getting too hot at the high charging rates this station is capable of producing. The pricing here is standard Electrify America rates for Oregon. A word of warning to users having issues with getting a charge to start here: The cables are very heavy and don't always make a perfect connection with some cars like the Chevy Bolt. This causes a connection error at the start of the charge. The solution is to hold up gently on the CCS cable and activate charging in the app while continuing the gentle upward pressure on the cable until the charging starts.

In both cases, calling customer service to troubleshoot was pretty frustrating - today, the rep insisted the problem was my car and not the station, even though 2 other brands of stations had worked for me in the past day. Immediately after our call I drove to a chargepoint station which worked successfully, so I followed up and informed Webasto that the problem was indeed their charger, not my car.

I am hoping Webasto addresses this issue - this location is so convenient and I‚Äôd love to charge here. Based on my experience and frustrations with the company though, I‚Äôll be charging elsewhere when available - have never had any reliability or customer service issues with other companies.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

As of this review, all 25 chargers work with ccs1, 23 work with tesla, and 2 work with chademo.

You could pay with credit card, or tap with the revel app if you put in payment info within the app. Just be aware that that I was told by a Revel tesla taxi driver that sometimes the payment might not work at a station from time to time. This happened to me on my first visit. I could not get my payment to work. The driver suggested I try a different stall and that solved the problem. So if you have trouble paying to get the chargers started, try try again.

As of this review, the price of the charge is priced at 39 cents a kwh plus tax. Some of the chargers says 75 kwh max but my tesla only got just below 50 max and at times dip to the high 30s. I read that is common. Not sure if that is limited to tesla or most evs here.

-If you are around the Elk Grove area, and you require a Supercharger Station ‚õΩ this one's got you covered, for now!

-With double rows and it being so close to the highway system and main roads, you will more than likely not have to travel too far for a quick charge!

-Within breathing distance and a stones throw to shopping, restaurants and boutique shops...this locations got your back!

Free level 2 charging for 2 hours
Close to lots of restaurants

Cons:
Very popular location and all of the chargers are usually occupied, so it is a bit of luck to be able to charge during most of the time

Most people that use the chargers have been considerate and move their car as soon as their two hours are up, but there are times when people park all day.
